<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3 id="AGE_OF_ABORIGINAL_AMERICAN_RECORDS">AGE OF ABORIGINAL AMERICAN RECORDS</h3>

<p>The desire to preserve to future ages the memory of past achievements
is a universal human instinct, as witness the clay tablets of old
Chaldea, the hieroglyphs of the obelisks, our countless thousands of
manuscripts and printed volumes, and the gossiping old story-teller
of the village or the backwoods cabin. The reliability of the record
depends chiefly on the truthfulness of the recorder and the adequacy
of the method employed. In Asia, the cradle of civilization, authentic
history goes back thousands of years; in Europe the record begins
much later, while in America the aboriginal narrative, which may be
considered as fairly authentic, is all comprised within a thousand years.</p>

<h3 id="ABORIGINAL_AMERICAN_CALENDARS">ABORIGINAL AMERICAN CALENDARS</h3>

<p>The peculiar and elaborate systems by means of which the more
cultivated ancient nations of the south recorded their histories are too
well known to students to need more than a passing notice here. It
was known that our own tribes had various ways of depicting their
mythology, their totems, or isolated facts in the life of the individual
or nation, but it is only within a few years that it was even suspected
that they could have anything like continuous historical records, even
in embryo.</p>

<p>The fact is now established, however, that pictographic records covering
periods of from sixty to perhaps two hundred years or more do, or
did, exist among several tribes, and it is entirely probable that every
leading mother tribe had such a record of its origin and wanderings,
the pictured narrative being compiled by the priests and preserved
with sacred care through all the shifting vicissitudes of savage life
until lost or destroyed in the ruin that overwhelmed the native governments
at the coming of the white man. Several such histories are now
known, and as the aboriginal field is still but partially explored, others
may yet come to light.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<h3 id="THE_WALAM_OLUM_OF_THE_DELAWARES">THE WALAM OLUM OF THE DELAWARES</h3>

<p>East of the Mississippi the most important and best known record
is the <i>Walam Olum</i> or "red score" of the Delawares, originally discovered
in 1820, and published by Dr D.G. Brinton in 1885. It consists
of a series of pictographs designed to fix in memory the verses of a
genesis and migration chant which begins with the mythic period and
comes down to the advent of the whites about the year 1610. It
appears to be genuine and ancient, although the written chant as we
find it contains modern forms, having of course been reduced to writing
within a comparatively recent period.</p>

<p>It is said that the Cherokee seventy years ago had a similar long
tribal tradition which was recited by the priests on ceremonial occasions.
If so, it was probably recorded in pictographs, but tradition and record
alike are now lost.</p>

<h3 id="THE_DAKOTA_CALENDARS">THE DAKOTA CALENDARS</h3>

<p>West of the Mississippi the first extended Indian calendar history
discovered was the "Lone-dog winter count," found among the Dakota
by Colonel Garrick Mallery, and first published by him in 1877.
This history of the Dakota was painted on a buffalo robe by Lone-dog,
of the Yanktonai tribe of that confederacy, and extends over a period
of seventy-one years, beginning in 1800. Subsequent investigation by
Colonel Mallery brought to light several other calendars in the same
tribe, some being substantially a copy of the first, others going back,
respectively, to 1786, 1775, and the mythic period.</p>

<p>In all these Dakota calendars there is only a single picture for each
year, with nothing to mark the division of summer and winter. As
they call a year a "winter," and as our year begins in the middle of
winter, it is consequently impossible, without some tally date from our
own records, to know in which of two consecutive years any event
occurred, i.e., whether before or after New Year. In this respect the
Kiowa calendars here published are much superior to those of the
Dakota.</p>

<h3 id="OTHER_TRIBAL_RECORDS">OTHER TRIBAL RECORDS</h3>

<p>Clark, in his book on Indian sign-language, mentions incidentally
that the Apache have similar picture histories, but gives no more
definite information as concerns that tribe. He goes on to say that the
Santee Sioux claim to have formerly kept a record of events by tying
knots in a string, after the manner of the Peruvian quipu. By the
peculiar method of tying and by means of certain marks they indicated
battles and other important events, and even less remarkable occurrences,
such as births, etc. He states that he saw among them a slender
pole about 6 feet in length, the surface of which was completely
covered with small notches, and the old Indian who had it assured him
that it had been handed down from father to son for many generations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
and that these notches represented the history of his tribe for more
than a thousand years, going back, indeed, to the time when they lived
near the ocean (<cite>Clark, 1</cite>).<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> In this case the markings must have been
suggestive rather than definite in their interpretation, and were probably
used in connection with a migration chant similar to that of the
Walam Olurn.</p>

<h3 id="THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">THE KIOWA CALENDARS</h3>

<h4 id="THE_ANNUAL_CALENDARS_OF_DOHASAN">THE ANNUAL CALENDARS OF DOHÁSÄN, POLÄÑ´YI-KATÓN, SET-T'AN, AND ANKO</h4>

<p>So far as known to the author, the Dakota calendars and the Kiowa
calendars here reproduced are the only ones yet discovered among
the prairie tribes. Dodge, writing in 1882, felt so confident that the
Dakota calendar of Mallery was the only one ever produced by our
Indians that he says, "I have therefore come to the conclusion that it
is unique, that there is no other such calendar among Indians.... I
now present it as a curiosity, the solitary effort to form a calendar ever
made by the plains Indians" (<cite>Dodge, 1</cite>). Those obtained by the author
among the Kiowa are three in number, viz: the Sett'an yearly calendar,
beginning with 1833 and covering a period of sixty years; the Anko
yearly calendar, beginning with 1864 and covering a period of twenty-nine
years; and the Anko monthly calendar, covering a period of
thirty-seven months. All these were obtained in 1892, and are brought
up to that date. The discovery of the Anko calendars was an indirect
result of having obtained the Sett'an calendar.</p>

<p>A fourth Kiowa calendar was obtained in the same year by Captain
H. L. Scott, Seventh cavalry, while stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
on the Kiowa reservation, and was by him generously placed at the
disposal of the author, together with all his notes bearing on the
subject. This calendar was procured from Dohásän, "Little-bluff,"
nephew of the celebrated Dohásän who was head chief of the Kiowa
tribe for more than thirty years. The nephew, who died in 1893 at an
advanced age, told Captain Scott that the calendar had been kept in
his family from his youth up, having originally been painted on hides,
which were renewed from time to time as they wore out from age and
handling. The calendar delivered by him to Scott is drawn with colored
pencils on heavy manila paper, as is also the Sett'an calendar
obtained by the author. In both, the pictographs are arranged in a
continuous spiral, beginning in the lower right-hand corner and ending
near the center, the rows of pictographs being separated from each
other by a continuous spiral. In both, the winter is designated by
means of an upright black bar, to indicate that vegetation was then dead,
while summer is represented by means of the figure of the medicine
lodge, the central object of the annual summer religious ceremony.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
The leading event of the season is indicated by means of a pictograph
above or beside the winter mark or medicine lodge. In a few instances,
in the earlier years, when the medicine dance was omitted, the event
recorded for the summer is placed between the consecutive winter
marks, without anything to show the season, but toward the end, when
the medicine dance had been practically discontinued, the summer is
indicated by the figure of a tree in foliage.</p>

<p>The general plan of the Anko calendar is the same, excepting that
the winter pictographs are below the winter marks, with which they
are connected by lines, the winter marks forming a single row across
the page, with the center pole of the medicine lodge, the summer pictographs
above and the winter pictographs below. This calendar was
originally drawn with a black pencil in a small notebook, and afterward,
by direction of the author, redrawn in colored inks on buckskin.
A comparison of the three justifies the assertion that the Kiowa have
a recognized system of calendar pictography. In artistic execution
the Sett'an calendar ranks first.</p>

<p>Still another calendar, thought to have dated farther back than any
of those now under consideration, was kept by an old man of the Kiowa
Apache named Polä´ñyi-katón, "Rabbit-shoulder," and is supposed
to have been buried with him at his death, a few years ago.</p>

<p>From the evidence it is probable that the first calendar within the
present knowledge of the Kiowa was kept by the old chief Doha´sän,
whose hereditary tipi occupied the first place in the camp circle of the
tribe, and in whose family certain priestly functions in connection with
the medicine dance descended in regular succession. After his death in
1866 it was continued and brought down to date by his nephew and
namesake, whose last revision is now in possession of Captain Scott.</p>

<p>The Sett'an calendar is an inspiration, but not a copy, from the
Dohásän calendar, of which it is almost an exact duplicate, but with
the addition of one or two pictographs, together with greater skill and
detail in execution. Sett'an stated that he had been fourteen years
drawing it; i. e., that he had begun work on it fourteen years before,
noting the events of the first six years from the statements of older
men, and the rest from his own recollection. He knew of the Dohásän
calendar, although he claimed never to have seen it, but from internal
evidence and from the man's general reputation for untruthfulness it
is probable that he had seen it sufficiently often to be able to reproduce
it from memory.</p>

<p>This will be understood when it is explained that it is customary for
the owners of such Indian heirlooms to bring them out at frequent
intervals during the long nights in the winter camp, to be exhibited and
discussed in the circle of warriors about the tipi fire. The signal for
such a gathering takes the form of an invitation to the others to "come
and smoke," shouted in a loud voice through the camp by the leader of
the assemblage while standing in front of his tipi, or even without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
passing outside, his voice easily being heard through the thin walls and
the smoke-hole of the lodge. At these gatherings the pipe is filled and
passed around, and each man in turn recites some mythic or historic
tradition, or some noted deed on the warpath, which is then discussed
by the circle. Thus the history of the tribe is formulated and handed
down.</p>

<p>Sett'an, "Little-bear," who is a cousin of the old war-chief, in whose
family the author makes his home when with the tribe, voluntarily
brought in and presented the calendar without demanding any payment
in return, saying that he had kept it for a long time, but that he
was now old and the young men were forgetting their history, and he
wanted it taken to Washington and preserved there with the other
things collected from the tribe, that the white people might always
remember what the Kiowa had done.</p>

<h4 id="THE_ANKO_MONTHLY_CALENDAR">THE ANKO MONTHLY CALENDAR</h4>

<p>The original monthly calendar of Anko (abbreviated from <i>Ankopaá-iñgyadéte</i>,
"In-the middle-of-many-tracks") was drawn in black pencil
in a continuous spiral, covering two pages of the notebook in which
his yearly calendar was recorded, and was redrawn by him in colored
inks, under the inspection of the author, on the same buckskin on
which the other was reproduced. It begins in the lower left-hand
corner. Each moon or month is represented by a crescent, above
which is a pictograph to indicate the event, or the name of the moon,
and sometimes also straight tally marks to show on what day of the
month the event occurred or the picture was drawn. So far this is
the only monthly calendar discovered among North American tribes,
but since the original was obtained, Anko has made another copy for
his own use and continued it up to date. His young wife being far
advanced in consumption, he spends most of his time at home with
her, which accounts in a measure for his studious habit. On the later
calendar he has noted with anxious care every hemorrhage or other
serious incident in her illness and every occasion when he has had
ceremonial prayers made for her recovery.</p>

<h3 id="COMPARATIVE_IMPORTANCE_OF_EVENTS_RECORDED">COMPARATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EVENTS RECORDED</h3>

<p>An examination of the calendars affords a good idea of the comparative
importance attached by the Indian and by the white man to the
same event. From the white man's point of view many of the things
recorded in these aboriginal histories would seem to be of the most
trivial consequence, while many events which we regard as marking
eras in the history of the plains tribes are entirely omitted. Thus there
is nothing recorded of the Custer campaign of 1868, which resulted in
the battle of the Washita and compelled the southern tribes for the
first time to go on a reservation, while the outbreak of 1874, which
terminated in their final subjugation, is barely noticed. On the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
hand, we find noted such incidents as the stealing of a horse or the
elopement of a woman. The records resemble rather the personal
reminiscences of a garrulous old man than the history of a nation.
They are the history of a people limited in their range of ideas and
interests, such materials as make up the chronicles of the highland
clans of Scotland or the annals of a medieval barony.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that an Indian tribe is simply a
large family, all the members being interrelated; this is particularly
true of the Kiowa, who number only about 1,100. An event which
concerns one becomes a matter of gossip and general knowledge in all
the camps and is thus exalted into a subject of tribal importance.
Moreover, an event, if it be of common note in the tribe, may be
recorded rather for its value as a tally date than for its intrinsic
importance.</p>

<p>On this point Mallery says, speaking of the Lone-dog calendar, that
it "was not intended to be a continuous history, or even to record the
most important event of each year, but to exhibit some one of special
peculiarity.... It would indeed have been impossible to have graphically
distinguished the many battles, treaties, horse stealings, big
hunts, etc, so most of them were omitted and other events of greater
individuality and better adapted for portrayal were taken for the year
count, the criterion being not that they were of historic moment, but
that they were of general notoriety, or perhaps of special interest to
the recorders" (<cite>Mallery, 1</cite>).</p>

<p>A brief interpretation of the calendars here described was obtained
from the original owners in 1892. To this was added, in the winter of
1894&mdash;95, all that could be procured from T'ébodal, Gaápiatañ, Â´dalpepte,
Set-ĭmkía, and other prominent old men of the tribe, together
with Captain Scott's notes and the statements of pioneer frontiersmen,
and all available printed sources of information, including the annual
reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for more than sixty years.
The Dohásän calendar is still in possession of Captain Scott. The
Sett'an and Anko calendars are now deposited in the Bureau of
American Ethnology.</p>

<h3 id="METHOD_OF_FIXING_DATES">METHOD OF FIXING DATES</h3>

<p>A few examples will show how the Kiowa keep track of their tribal
and family affairs by means of these calendars. Sett'an was born in
"cut-throat summer" (1833), and his earliest recollection is of the "head-dragging
winter" (1837&mdash;38). Set-ĭmkía, better known as Stumbling-bear,
was about a year old in "cut-throat summer" (1833). He was
married in "dusty medicine dance" summer (1851). His daughter
Virginia was born in the summer of "No-arm's river medicine
dance" (1863), and her husband was born a little earlier, in "tree-top
winter" (1862&mdash;63). Gruñsádalte, commonly known as Cat, was born in
the "winter that Buffalo-tail was killed" (1835&mdash;36); his son Angópte
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
was born in "muddy traveling winter" (1864&mdash;65), and his younger son
Másép was born in "bugle scare winter" (1869&mdash;70). Paul Setk'opte
first saw light among the Cheyenne the winter after the "showery
medicine dance" (1853), and joined the Kiowa in the autumn after the
"smallpox medicine dance" (1862).</p>

<h3 id="SCOPE_OF_THE_MEMOIR">SCOPE OF THE MEMOIR</h3>

<p>As the Kiowa and associated Apache are two typical and extremely
interesting plains tribes, about which little is known and almost nothing
has been printed, the introductory tribal sketch has been made more
extended than would otherwise have been the case. As they ranged
within the historic period from Canada to central Mexico and from
Arkansas to the borders of California, they came in contact with nearly
all the tribes on this side of the Columbia river region and were visitors
in peace or war at most of the military and trading posts within the
same limits. For this reason whatever seemed to have important bearing
on the Indian subject has been incorporated in the maps with the
purpose that the work might serve as a substantial basis for any future
historical study of the plains tribes.</p>

refer to their mythic origin or to their coming into the plains region. The name

<h3 id="TRIBAL_SIGN">TRIBAL SIGN</h3>

<p>To make the sign for "Kiowa" in the sign language of the plains
tribes, the right hand is held close to the right cheek, with back down,
fingers touching and slightly curved, and the hand moved in a rotary
motion from the wrist. According to the Kiowa this sign had its origin
in an old custom of their warriors, who formerly cut the hair from the
right side of the head, on a line with the base of the ear, in order better
to display the ear pendants, while allowing it to grow to full length
on the left side, so as to be braided and wrapped with otter skin after
the common fashion of the southern plains tribes. This was in addition
to the ordinary small scalplock hanging down behind. This style of
wearing the hair, although now nearly obsolete from long association
with tribes of different habit, is still occasionally seen. It is shown in
the picture of the chief Big-bow, taken in 1870 (<a href="#fig43">figure 43</a>).</p>

<p>Dodge thus correctly explains the sign: "<span class="smcap">Kiowa</span>&mdash;The open palm,
held bowl-shaped, to right of and beside the face, is passed round and
round in a circle. Supposed to indicate the peculiarity of these Indians
in cutting the hair of the right side of the head" (<cite>Dodge, 2</cite>).</p>

<p>The sign has no connection with the idea of "rattle-brain," "crazy
head," "crazy knife," "drinking water," or "prairie people rising up,"
as has been variously stated; neither is the sign ever properly made
on the left side. Such misconceptions have arisen from the careless
making of the sign by persons ignorant of its true meaning. The
Cheyenne claim that it refers to a former Kiowa custom of painting a
stripe across the upper lip and cheeks. This is probably only an
attempt to explain the name <i>Witapätu</i>, q.v., without any basis in fact,
for, had such a custom existed, it would have been indicated by drawing
the finger across the face. Moreover, in a series of forty figures
painted for the author by Kiowa Indians to illustrate their ancient
styles of war paint, not one is thus depicted.</p>

</div>

<p>The Gâ´igwŭ´ or Kiowa, although originating in the far north, have
been known for the last sixty years as one of the principal and most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
predatory tribes of the southern plains. Their linguistic affinity is
still uncertain, the language apparently having no connection with that
of any other tribe. This uncertainty, however, is due largely to the
paucity of the linguistic material thus far collected from them, and to
the fact that philologists have made the comparison with the languages
of the southern tribes, with whom the Kiowa were found most closely
associated, rather than with that of tribes nearer the Canadian border,
whence they have drifted to the south. Another thing which serves to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
render comparison difficult is the fact that the Kiowa have the custom
of dropping from the language any word which suggests the name of
a person recently deceased, and substituting for the tabooed word
another which will convey the same idea. The old word may be
restored after a term of years, but it frequently happens that the new
one keeps its place and the original word is entirely forgotten. The
change is a new combination of existing roots, or a new use of an existing
word, rather than the deliberate invention of a new word, although
in some instances words seem to be borrowed for this purpose from
existing languages. The same custom exists to a limited degree among
the Comanche, who may have adopted it in consequence of their association
with the Kiowa, and perhaps among other tribes. With the
Kiowa it is carried to such an extent that old men sometimes remember
as many as three names which have been used in chronologic succession
for the same object. Further linguistic investigation may
result in establishing their affinity with the Athapascan, northern
Shoshonean, or Salishan tribes.</p>

<h3 id="TRIBAL_NAMES">TRIBAL NAMES</h3>

<p><i>Kiowa</i>, the name by which the tribe is commonly known to the whites,
is from the softened Comanche form of the name by which they call
themselves, Gâ´igwŭ´ (<a href="#KIOWA-ENGLISH_GLOSSARY">see the glossary</a>). It is claimed by one or two
old men that Gâ´igwŭ´ was not originally their proper name, but a
foreign name adopted by the tribe, and untranslatable in their own
language. However that may be, it is now, in its root form, <i>Gâi</i>,
synonymous with Kiowa, whether applied to the individual, language,
territory, or utensils of the tribe. It is also the name of one of their
recognized tribal divisions. Ancient names used to designate themselves
are <i>Kwú'dă´</i> and afterward <i>Tépdă´</i>, both names signifying
"coming out," perhaps in allusion to their mystic origin. These two
names are known now only to their oldest men. They sometimes refer
to themselves as <i>Kómpabíăntă</i>, or people of the "large tipi flaps,"
although, so far as observation goes, their tipis are not peculiar in this
respect. Their name for Indians in general is <i>Gíăguádaltágâ</i>, "people
of the red flesh." Among other tribes they are called by various names,
the best known being the Dakota or Cheyenne form <i>Witapähätu</i>, of
doubtful translation. The tribal sign, a quick motion of the hand past
the right cheek, they explain as referring to a former custom of cutting
the hair on that side on a level with the ear.</p>

<h3 id="GENESIS_AND_MIGRATION">GENESIS AND MIGRATION</h3>

<p>According to Kiowa mythology, which has close parallels among
other tribes, their first ancestors emerged from a hollow cottonwood log
at the bidding of a supernatural progenitor. They came out one at a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
time as he tapped upon the log until it came to the turn of a pregnant
woman, who stuck fast in the hole and thus blocked the way for those
behind her so that they were unable to follow, which accounts for the
small number of the Kiowa tribe. The same being gave them the
sun, made the division of day and night, exterminated a number of
malevolent monsters, and rendered the most ferocious animals harmless;
he also taught them their simple hunting arts and finally left
them to take his place among the stars. Other wonderful things were
done for them by a supernatural boy hero, whose father was the son of
the Sun and whose mother was an earthly woman. This boy afterward
transformed himself into two, and finally gave himself to the Kiowa in
eucharistic form as a tribal "medicine," which they still retain. Unlike
the neighboring Cheyenne and Arapaho, who yet remember that they
once lived east of the Missouri and cultivated corn, the Kiowa have no
tradition of ever having been an agricultural people or anything but a
tribe of hunters.</p>

<p>Leaving the mythic or genesis period, the earliest historic tradition
of the Kiowa locates them in or beyond the mountains at the extreme
sources of the Yellowstone and the Missouri, in what is now western
Montana. They describe it as a region of great cold and deep snows,
and say that they had the Flatheads (<i>Â´daltoñ-ká-igihä´go</i>, "compressed
head people") near them, and that on the other side of the
mountains was a large stream flowing westward, evidently an upper
branch of the Columbia. These mountains they still call <i>Gá´i K'op</i>,
"Kiowa mountains." Here, they say, while on a hunting expedition
on one occasion, a dispute occurred between two rival chiefs over the
possession of the udder of a female antelope, a delicacy particularly
prized by Indians. The dispute grew into an angry quarrel, with the
result that the chief who failed to secure the coveted portion left the
party and withdrew with his band toward the northwest, while the rest
of the tribe moved to the southeast, crossed the Yellowstone (<i>Tsósá
P'a</i>, "pipe (?) stone river"), and continued onward until they met the
Crows (<i>Gaă-k'íägo</i>, "crow people"), with whom they had hitherto been
unacquainted. By permission of the Crows they took up their residence
east of that tribe, with which they made their first alliance. Up
to this time they had no horses, but used only dogs and the travois.
For a while they continued to visit the mountains, but finally drifted
out into the plains, where they first procured horses and became
acquainted with the Arapaho and Cheyenne, and later with the Dakota.</p>

<p>Keim, writing in 1870, says that the Kiowa "claim that their primitive
country was in the far north," from which they were driven out by
wars, moving by the aid of dogs and dog sledges. "From the north
they reached a river, now the south fork of the Platte. Their residence
upon this river is within the recollection of the old men of the tribe.
Not satisfied with the Platte country, they moved on across the Republican
and Smoky Hill rivers until they reached the Arkansas. Thence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
they moved upon the headwaters of the Cimarron. Here they permanently
located their council fire, and after much fighting secured control
of all the country south of Arkansas river and north of the Wichita
mountains and headwaters of Red river" (<cite>Keim, 1</cite>).</p>

<p>There can be no doubt as to the correctness of the main points of this
tradition, which is corroborated by the testimony of the northern Arapaho
and other tribes of that region. While to the ordinary reader the
result of the quarrel may seem out of all due proportion to the cause,
it will not appear so to anyone familiar with Indian life and thought.
The savage is intellectually a child, and from the point of view of
civilized man his history is shaped by trivial things, as will be sufficiently
apparent from a study of the calendars. It is said that a war
between the Delaware and Shawano originated in a dispute between two
children concerning a grasshopper. The Crows themselves, according
to their own story, separated from their kinsmen the Hidatsa or
Minitari on the Missouri for a reason precisely like that of the Kiowa
tradition&mdash;a quarrel between two chiefs over the proper division of a
buffalo (<cite>Matthews, 1</cite>; <cite>Clark, 2</cite>.) A similar story is related to account
for the origin of one of the bands of the Dakota. Among wandering
hunters disputes in regard to the possession or division of game have
always been the most potent causes of separations and tribal wars.</p>

<p>In regard to the dissatisfied band that went to the north, the Kiowa
have a fixed belief that their lost kindred, whom they call <i>Azä´tañhop</i>
("those who went away dissatisfied on account of the udder"), are still
in existence beyond the mountains somewhere to the north or northwest
of their old home, where they still speak the old Kiowa language.
They assert as positively that they have no relatives in any other
quarter, east, west, or south. Several stories are current in the tribe
in support of this belief. One woman, now about 80 years of age,
when a child was taken by her father with others on a visit to their old
friends, the Crows, and says that while there they met a white trader
from the north, who addressed them in the Kiowa tongue, which he
said he learned from a tribe living farther north, which spoke the
Kiowa language. Again, they say that when the Nez Percés (<i>Â´dalkatóigo</i>,
"people with hair cut round across the forehead"), who had
been brought down as prisoners to Indian Territory, visited them in
1883, they told the Kiowa that they knew a people who lived in the
"white mountains" west of the old home of the Nez Percés in Idaho,
and who spoke a language similar to Kiowa. Whatever weight we
may attach to these stories, they at least offer a suggestion concerning
the direction in which the linguistic affinity of the Kiowa is to be
sought.</p>

<p>Bearing on the subject of the early habitat of the tribe, it may further
be stated that, while making a collection among the Kiowa a few
years ago, the author obtained from them a small cradle which is
essentially different from any now in use among the Kiowa or any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
other of the well-known prairie tribes, in that the buckskin covering
is attached directly to a solid board back, which is elaborately carved
and painted in the style characteristic of the tribes of the Columbia
and the northwest coast. On asking the old woman who made it,
where she had obtained the idea, she replied that it was the kind the
Kiowa used to make a very long time ago. On showing it afterward to
Dr Washington Matthews, the distinguished ethnologist and anatomist,
he expressed the opinion that such a cradle would produce a flattened
skull. It is now in the National Museum at Washington.</p>

<h3 id="EARLY_ALLIANCE_WITH_THE_CROWS">EARLY ALLIANCE WITH THE CROWS</h3>

<p>The leading facts in the traditional history of the Kiowa are those of
their early residence at the extreme head of the Missouri and their
subsequent removal to the east and alliance with the Crows. It is
impossible to assign any definite date to this early migration from the
mountain country, but it was probably about or before 1700. It was
subsequent to the separation of the Crows from the Hidatsa, an event
which probably took place before the end of the seventeenth century
(<cite>Matthews, 2</cite>; <cite>Clark, 3</cite>), and it must have been long before the discovery
of the Black Hills by the Dakota, which, according to a calendar
of that people, occurred in 1775 (<cite>Mallery, 2</cite>). The present <i>tai-me</i>
or sun-dance "medicine" of the Kiowa was obtained from the Crows
while the two tribes were neighbors in the north, at a date probably
very near 1765. It is probable that scarcity of game or severity of
climate had much to do with their original removal from the head of
the Missouri, but it is worthy of note that in all their wanderings the
Kiowa have never, for any long period, entirely abandoned the mountains.
After making friends with the Crows, they established themselves
in the Black Hills until driven out by the invading Dakota and
Cheyenne, and now for seventy years or more they have had their main
headquarters in the Wichita mountains.</p>

<p>The northern Arapaho, now living on a reservation in Wyoming,
have distinct recollection of this former northern residence of the
Kiowa, with whom in the old times they were on terms of intimate
friendship. While visiting them in 1892 they informed the author that
when they first knew the Kiowa that tribe lived about the Three forks
of the Missouri, near where are now Gallatin and Virginia City, Montana.
This information, obtained from old men without the use of
leading questions, and with the aid of good maps, tallies exactly with
the earliest tradition of the Kiowa tribe. They say further that the
Kiowa moved down from the mountains and eastward along the Yellowstone
in company with the Crows, and then turned southeastward
to about the present neighborhood of Fort Robinson, Nebraska, where
they parted with the Crows and continued southward. "Plenty-poles,"
then nearly ninety years of age, first met the Kiowa when he was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
small boy on the head of the North Platte, west of the present town of
Cheyenne, Wyoming.</p>

<p>The friendship between the Kiowa and the Crows was close and intimate,
in spite of occasional quarrels, and continued after the Kiowa
had entirely removed from the north and established themselves on the
Arkansas. They made common cause against the invading Dakota
and Cheyenne from the east, by whom they were finally dispossessed.
As already stated, the Kiowa obtained their present <i>tai-me</i> or sun-dance
medicine from the Crows, and the sacred arrow lance of Tängúadal's
family came originally from the same source. For a long time
after removing from the north it was a frequent occurrence for Kiowa
fathers to make visits to the Crows and leave with that tribe their
young children for two or three years in order that they might learn
the Crow language and thus help to preserve the old friendship. There
are still several old people among the Kiowa who have a considerable
Crow vocabulary acquired in this way. Conversely, the northern
Arapaho state that the Crows refer to the Kiowa as their relatives,
and that some of them speak a little of the language acquired during
similar visits to the south.</p>

<h3 id="THE_ASSOCIATED_KIOWA_APACHE">THE ASSOCIATED KIOWA APACHE</h3>

<p>Incorporated with the Kiowa, and forming a component part of their
tribal circle, is a small tribe of Athapascan stock, commonly known as
Apache or Kiowa Apache, but calling themselves <i>Nadiisha Dena</i>.
They are not a detached band of the Apache tribe proper of Arizona,
as has commonly been supposed, but came down with the Kiowa from
the north, and neither tribe has any tradition of a time when they
were not associated. They will be spoken of at length later on. This
ancient Athapascan alliance is another link in the chain connecting
the Kiowa with the far north.</p>

<h3 id="THE_HISTORICAL_PERIOD">THE HISTORICAL PERIOD</h3>

<h4 id="POSSESSION_OF_THE_BLACK_HILLS">POSSESSION OF THE BLACK HILLS</h4>

<p>We come now to more definite historic ground. Situated east of the
Crows, the Kiowa took possession of the Black Hills (<i>Sádalkáñi K`op</i>,
"stomach-rind, i. e., 'manifold,' mountains"), and having by this time
procured some horses, began to make raids on the Spanish frontiers
to the south, while they established a friendly trade and intercourse
with the Arikara and Mandan on the Missouri. They are mentioned
under the name of Cargua (for Caigua) in a Spanish document of 1732,
and again as Caigua in 1735. In 1748 the Spanish historian Villaseñor
mentions the "Cayguas," in connection with Comanche, Apache,
Navaho, and Ute, as among the hostile tribes of New Mexico (see the
<a href="#TRIBAL_SYNONYMY">synonymy</a>). It will be remembered that the greater portion of what is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
now Colorado was included with New Mexico under Spanish domination.
If, as seems possible, they are identical with the Manrhoat or
Manrhout of La Salle, allies of the Gattacka (Kiowa Apache), our
knowledge of the tribe would go back to 1682. They continued to
occupy the Black Hills until about the close of the last century, when
they were driven out by the Dakota advancing from the east, and by
the Cheyenne who crossed the Missouri from the northeast. The
same pressure drove their old allies, the Crows, farther westward.</p>

<p>The northern Cheyenne informed Grinnell that on first coming into
their present country they had found the region between the Yellowstone
and Cheyenne rivers, including the Black Hills, in possession of
the Kiowa and Comanche (?), whom they drove out and forced to the
south. When the author was among the Dakota some years ago, they
informed him that they had first known the Kiowa in the Black Hills,
and had driven them out from that region. This is admitted by the
Kiowa, who continued at war with the Dakota and Cheyenne until
about 1840, when a permanent peace was made. It does not appear
that the Arapaho had anything to do with this expulsion of the Kiowa,
with whom they seem generally to have been on friendly terms,
although at a later period we find them at war with the Kiowa, being
probably drawn into hostilities through their connection with the
Cheyenne. As is well known to ethnologists, the Dakota are comparatively
recent immigrants from east of the Missouri. They first reached
the Black Hills in 1775, as already stated, so that the final expulsion
of the Kiowa must have occurred between that date and 1805, when
Lewis and Clark found the Cheyenne in possession of the same region,
the Cheyenne being then at war with the Dakota. Curiously enough,
there is no note of this war on any of the several Dakota calendars
covering this period, described and illustrated by Mallery, although
we find a reference to the killing of a Kiowa in the winter of 1814&mdash;15.</p>

<h4 id="THE_EXTINCT_KUATO">THE EXTINCT K'ÚATO</h4>

<p>The Kiowa have a better memory, and one of their old hero stories
relates to the slaughter of an entire band of Kiowa by the Dakota.
The ill-fated band was called the <i>K'úato</i>, a name signifying "pulling
up, or pulling out" from the ground or from a hole, being indicated in
the sign language by the motion of "pulling up" with one or both
hands. According to the story the Kiowa, apparently nearly the whole
tribe together, were attacked by an overwhelming body of the Dakota.
Finding resistance hopeless, they fled, but the chief of the K'úato urged
his people not to run, "because if they did their relatives in the other
world would not receive them." Inspired to desperate courage by his
words, the K'úato faced the enemy and were all killed where they stood,
excepting one woman who had fled with the others. According to
Te'bodal, who was born about 1817 and is now the oldest man in the
tribe, this massacre took place when his grandfather was a young man,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
perhaps about 1770. Te'bodal himself remembered having seen the
single woman survivor. It is said that the K'úato spoke a peculiar
dialect of the Kiowa language, although recognized as a part of the tribe,
and were noted for doing foolish and ridiculous things, a statement
borne out by the story of their extermination.</p>

<h4 id="INTERCOURSE_WITH_THE_ARIKARA_MANDAN_AND_HIDATSA">INTERCOURSE WITH THE ARIKARA, MANDAN, AND HIDATSA</h4>

<p>Next to the Crows, the Kiowa have most to say of their friendship
in these old days with the Arikara (Ree), Mandan, and Hidatsa or
Minitari on Missouri river. For many years these three confederated
tribes, now reduced to about 1,100 souls in all, have occupied jointly
a single village on the northeastern bank of Missouri river, in the
vicinity of old Fort Berthold, about opposite Knife river, in North
Dakota. In 1805 the three tribes, with a small subtribe, now extinct,
occupied eight villages, with a total population of nearly 6,000 souls.
The Arikara were then considerably farther down the river, while the
others were nearly in their present position. From the fact that
Grand river, South Dakota, is known to the Dakota as Arikara river
it is probable that the Arikara formerly had their residence there for a
long period. In habits and home life the three tribes are almost identical,
being sedentary agriculturists, living in substantial earth-covered
log houses; but in language they are quite distinct. The Arikara or Ree
are a branch, of the Pawnee and speak a dialect of that language; the
Hidatsa, Grosventres, or Minitari were formerly a part of the Crows
and speak a dialect of that language; while the language of the Mandan
is distinct from either of the others, although remotely cognate with the
Hidatsa. They are mentioned prominently by every traveler in that
region during the last century, the best description of them being given
by Matthews in his work on the Hidatsa.</p>

<p>The definite recollection which the Kiowa have of these tribes shows
that they must have been very intimate with them in former times,
especially with the Arikara, whom they call <i>K'át'á</i>, "biters," designating
them in the sign language by a twisting motion of the closed right
band, with thumb extended, in front of the month, the allusion being to
gnawing corn from a cob. In the north the sign is sometimes made
with both hands, the right working against the left, the allusion then
being to shelling corn. The Arikara are preeminently distinguished
among the northern tribes as the corn-planting Indians, and are usually
designated in pictographs by the figure of a man with an ear of corn.
It is probable that they taught agriculture to the Mandan and Hidatsa.
The Kiowa further identify the K'át'á as being called <i>Paläni</i> by the
Dakota and as speaking a language like that of the Pawnee. Stumbling-bear
claims to have met and talked with some of them on a former
visit to Washington. They have more to say of the Arikara than of
the others, probably because then, as now, they were the largest of the
three tribes, and also, as the Kiowa themselves say, because the Arikara
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
lived nearest, being probably located then, as at a later period, on Ree
or Grand river, in South Dakota, which is called by their name in the
various Indian languages. They describe the three tribes as living on
the Missouri (<i>Tsosâ P'a</i>) river, in earth-covered grass houses (really
log houses, filled in between the logs with grass and covered with earth),
and cultivating corn and tobacco, which they traded to the Kiowa.
One of the principal divisions of the Kiowa tribe, and the one to which
the great Dohásän and several other prominent chiefs belonged, is the
K`at'a or Arikara band, so called, the Kiowa state, on account of their
special intimacy with the Arikara in the old times, and not because of
Arikara descent. The name of the band must have originated, of
course, subsequently to the first acquaintance of the two tribes.</p>

<p>The Mandan they call <i>Dóhón</i>, "the last tipi," assigning as a reason
for the name that they lived farthest toward the east. The Mandan,
unlike the other tribes, did in fact have one of their villages on the
farther (eastern) bank of the Missouri. They also sometimes call them
<i>Dowákohón</i>, an older form of Dohon, and <i>Sabă´</i>, "stingy," perhaps
from some trade dispute. In the sign language the Kiowa designate
them by indicating tattoo marks, stating that the women, and sometimes
the men, tattooed the arms, breast, and around the lips. This
agrees exactly with Clark, who says that the proper sign for Mandan
is intended to indicate tattooing on the chin and lower part of the face.
He states also, on the authority of an old plainsman, that fifty years
ago the Mandan women had a small spot tattooed on the forehead,
together with a line on the chin, while of the men the chiefs alone were
tattooed, this being done on one side, or one-half of the breast, or on
one arm and breast (<cite>Clark, 4</cite>). It may be that the small tattooed circle
on the foreheads of many Kiowa women is an imitation from their Mandan
sisters. Matthews says that he has seen a few old men of the
Hidatsa with parallel bands tattooed on the chest, throat, and arms,
but not on any other part of the body, or on any young or middle-age
persons in the tribe (<cite>Matthews, 3</cite>).</p>

<p>The Hidatsa or Minitari are known to the Kiowa as <i>Henóñko</i>, a name
which they can not translate. In this word the terminal <i>ko</i> is the tribal
suffix, while <i>Henóñ</i> is the root, possibly a derivative from <i>Herantsa</i>,
another form of Hidatsa, the Kiowa having no <i>r</i> in their language. To
designate them in the sign language, they make a gesture as if dipping
up water with the hand, referring to their common name of Minitari,
"water crossers," or "water people." This sign is probably now obsolete
in the north, as it is not noted by either Clark or Mallery. They say
that the Henoñko called the Kiowa <i>Datûmpáta</i>. The Kiowa describe
the three tribes as about the same in regard to house-building methods
and the cultivation of corn and Indian tobacco. They have also a distinct
recollection of the peculiar "bull boats," tub-shaped and covered
with rawhide, used by the Mandan and their allies. They ascribe
these boats more particularly to the Mandan, from whom perhaps the
Arikara obtained them after moving up to the same neighborhood.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<h4 id="RECOLLECTIONS_OF_OTHER_NORTHERN_TRIBES">RECOLLECTIONS OF OTHER NORTHERN TRIBES</h4>

<p>The old men who have most knowledge of this northern residence
and alliance with the Crows and Arikara say, after the Indian style of
chronology, that it was in the time when their grandfathers were young
men, and when they still had but few horses and commonly used dogs
as pack animals in traveling. One of the mythic legends of the tribe
accounts for the origin of the Black Hills (<i>Sádalkañi K`op</i>, "manifold
mountains"), and another deals with the noted Bear Lodge or Devil's
Tower (<i>Tsó-aí</i>, "tree rock," i. e., monument rock), near Sun Dance,
Wyoming, which they claim is within their old country. Beyond the
Yellowstone (<i>Tsósâ P'a</i>) they say lived the Blackfeet (<i>Tóñkóñko</i>,
"blackleg people") and the Arapaho Gros Ventres (<i>Botk`iägo</i>, "belly
people"). They knew also the Shoshoni (<i>Sondóta</i>, "grass houses"),
who, they say, formerly lived in houses of interwoven rushes or grass;
the Flatheads, the northern Arapaho, and of course the Dakota. It
is somewhat remarkable that they knew also the small tribe of Sarsi,
living on the Canadian side of the line at the source of the North Saskatchewan,
whom they describe accurately as a tribe living with the
Blackfeet and speaking a language resembling that of the Apache.
They call them <i>Pák`iägo</i>, which they render "stupid people," indicating
the tribe in the sign language by a sweeping motion of the right hand
across the thigh, perhaps from a confusion with <i>paki</i>, thigh. It is
possible that the name is not really of Kiowa origin, but is derived
from <i>Päki</i> or <i>Päkiani</i>, the Shoshoni name for the Blackfeet themselves.
The Kiowa call the Brulé Dakota <i>Pakí-gudălkantă</i>, "red-burnt thigh"
people, with the same gesture sign as for the Sarsi. Several prominent
men of the Kiowa tribe, among whom may be mentioned Gaápiatañ
and Pá-tádal, are of Sarsi descent. The maternal grandmother of the
noted chief Setäñgya, killed at Fort Sill in 1871, was a Sarsi woman
who married a Kiowa man during an interchange of friendly visits
between the two tribes. By reason of this Athapascan blood, those of
Sarsi descent, including Gaápiatañ, who is Setäñgya's nephew, consider
themselves in a measure related to the Kiowa Apache.</p>

<p>From the beginning the Kiowa say that they were usually on friendly
terms with the Crows, Arapaho, Arikara, Mandan, and Hidatsa, and,
so far as they can recollect, with the Shoshoni and Flatheads, the
friendship being interrupted, however, by occasional quarrels more or
less serious. They were frequently at war with the Cheyenne, and
always, from their first acquaintance, with the Dakota, Pawnee, and
Ute. Their relations with the southern tribes will be noted hereafter.</p>

<h4 id="ACQUIREMENT_OF_HORSES">ACQUIREMENT OF HORSES</h4>

<p>Although the Kiowa had no horses until they came down from the
mountains and settled near the Crows, it is probable that they obtained
some very soon afterward, probably from their friends the Crows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
La Salle, in 1682, states that the Gattacka (Kiowa Apache) and Manrhoat
(Kiowa?) had then plenty of horses, which he says they had probably
stolen from New Mexico (<cite>Margry, 1</cite>).</p>

<p>The notice in Villaseñor would indicate that they were able to mount
some of their warriors as early as 1748, as it is hardly probable that
they would have been able to attract attention by their inroads so far
south as the Spanish settlements if their warriors had been obliged to
travel entirely on foot. With some tribes, however, notably the Pawnee,
it was a frequent practice for the warriors to go out on foot, returning,
if successful, mounted on the horses taken from their enemies. Horses
must also have been taken by the Kiowa from the Comanche, who
lived south of them in the territory adjoining the Spanish possessions,
and with whom the Kiowa were then at war. In the beginning of the
present century we find the Kiowa mentioned as possessing large herds
of horses, which they traded with the Arikara and Mandan for European
goods.</p>

<p>Horace Jones, interpreter at Fort Sill, states that at a council held at
Fort Cobb in 1868, Ten-bears, an old Comanche chief, scorned the Kiowa
for their constant raids into Mexico and Texas in spite of their promises
to the government to cease such practices, saying to the assembled
Kiowa, "When we first knew you, you had nothing but dogs and sleds.
Now you have plenty of horses, and where did you get them if they were
not stolen from Mexico?" This must be interpreted, however, from a
point of comparison of the Comanche, who have long been noted for
the number of their ponies. It was certainly a case of the pot calling
the kettle black, as the principal business of both tribes for generations,
until confined to a reservation, was that of raiding their southern
neighbors in order to obtain horses and captives. It is unnecessary to
dilate on the revolution made in the life of the Indian by the possession
of the horse. Without it he was a half-starved skulker in the timber,
creeping up on foot toward the unwary deer or building a brush corral
with infinite labor to surround a herd of antelope, and seldom venturing
more than a few days' journey from home. With the horse he was
transformed into the daring buffalo hunter, able to procure in a single
day enough food to supply his family for a year, leaving him free then
to sweep the plains with his war parties along a range of a thousand
miles.</p>

<h4 id="INTERCOURSE_AND_WAR_WITH_THE_COMANCHE">INTERCOURSE AND WAR WITH THE COMANCHE</h4>

<p>While the Kiowa still occupied the Black Hills their nearest neighbors
toward the south were the Comanche, whose language and traditions
show them to be a comparatively recent offshoot from the Shoshoni of
Wyoming, and whose war parties formerly ranged from Platte river to
central Mexico. In 1724 Bourgmont describes them, under the name
of Padouca, as located between the headwaters of Platte and Kansas
rivers. Like the other prairie tribes, they drifted steadily southward,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
and about the middle of last century were established chiefly about the
upper Arkansas and its principal tributaries. Long before this time,
however, the <i>Pénätĕka</i> division had separated from the main body and
gone down into Texas. Pádouca, the name used by Bourgmont, is one
form of the name by which the Comanche are known to the Osage,
Dakota, and related tribes, and is probably derived from <i>Pénätĕka</i>.</p>

<p>As the Kiowa pressed southward before the advancing Dakota and
Cheyenne, they encountered the Comanche, resulting in a warfare continuing
many years, in the course of which the Comanche were gradually
driven south of the Arkansas. The war was finally terminated
and a lasting peace and alliance effected between the two tribes
through the good offices of the Spaniards of New Mexico.</p>

<h4 id="PEACE_WITH_THE_COMANCHE">PEACE WITH THE COMANCHE</h4>

<p>Now the Kiowa tradition becomes clear and detailed. According to
the story which the old men had from their fathers, who were contemporary
with the events, the Kiowa advanced along the base of the
mountains and pushed the Comanche from the northern head streams
of the Arkansas. When both sides were about worn out with fighting,
it happened that a small party of Kiowa on a friendly visit to a Spanish
settlement southwestward from that river&mdash;perhaps Las Vegas or
possibly Santa Fé&mdash;stopped to rest at a house, which they particularly
state was not a fort or trading post. The house was a large one with
several rooms, and by a curious coincidence a party of Comanche had
arrived shortly before and were then talking in the next room, all unaware
of the near presence of their enemies. Hearing the voices and recognizing
the language, the Kiowa at once prepared for battle, and
another bloody encounter was about to be added to the long list, when
their Mexican host, friendly to both sides, interposed and represented
to the Kiowa that now was their opportunity to establish a lasting
peace with their foes, offering his own services as mediator. After
some debate the Kiowa accepted his proposition, and the kindly Mexican,
going into the next room, informed the astonished Comanche that
a party of their hated enemies was outside waiting to talk of peace.
Being assured that no treachery was intended, they came out and the
leaders of the two parties saluted each other. The Kiowa leader,
whose name was Guik`áte, "Wolf-lying-down," and who was next in
authority to the principal chief of the tribe, assuming to speak for his
people, then expressed their desire for peace. To this the Comanche
leader, Päréiyä, "Afraid-of-water" (<i>Toñpeto</i> in the Kiowa language),
replied that as this was a matter of grave importance, it would have to
be considered by the whole tribe, and invited the Kiowa to go back
with them to the Comanche country in order that the business might
there be fully discussed. The Kiowa hesitated, not yet being quite
willing to trust themselves in the lion's den, when Guik`áte, anxious to
spare further bloodshed, said, "I am a chief. I am not afraid to die.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
I will go." A Comanche captive among the Kiowa volunteered to go
with him. Turning then to his followers, he said to them, "Go home
and tell our tribe that I am gone to make peace with the Comanche.
Return for me to this place when the leaves are yellow. If you do not
find me here, know that I am dead and avenge my death." He then
dismissed them, and the Kiowa started homeward, while he, with the
captive and one or two Mexicans accompanied the Comanche to their
camps on <i>Gañta P'a</i>, the Double-mountain fork of the Brazos, in Texas.</p>

<p>On arriving there with his escort, the Comanche were at first disposed
to regard him as an enemy and made a show of preparing to
revenge upon him the losses they had suffered at the hands of his people,
but finding that he was a brave man not to be easily frightened,
they changed their purpose and gave him a friendly welcome. He
remained with them all summer, being well entertained by them on the
hunt and at their social gatherings, and when at last the leaves began
to turn, the tipis were taken down, and the whole band, having long
ago decided on peace, moved off to meet the Kiowa at the appointed
rendezvous. They had not long to wait, for Indians observe the season
changes closely, before the whole warrior body of the Kiowa tribe
appeared in sight, prepared either to make a treaty of perpetual friendship
or to avenge the death of their chief, as the case might be. As
they approached, the Comanche chief and Guik`áte rode out to meet
them, somewhat to the surprise of the Kiowa, who had hardly hoped
ever again to see their kinsman alive. He told the story of his kind
treatment at the hands of the Comanche and their earnest desire for
peace, and the result was a treaty of friendship and alliance which
endures to this day, the two tribes, with the Kiowa-Apache, having
ever since occupied a common territory and acted together on all
important occasions, notwithstanding radical differences in language,
ceremonies, and temperament. The former condition of hostility is
clearly shown by the fact that the common name of the Kiowa for their
present allies, the Comanche, is <i>Gyái'ko</i>, "Enemies."</p>

<p>This treaty with the Comanche must have been made toward the
close of the last century, probably about 1790. As there is no tally date
in Kiowa history until we come to "the year when the stars fell," i. e.,
1833, a description of the manner in which we arrive at this conclusion
may be of interest as a specimen of the ordinary methods of Indian
chronology.</p>

<p>Among the oldest men of the tribe are T'ébodal, "One who carries a
buffalo's lower leg, "Gaápiatañ, "Feathered lance," (commonly known
as Heidsick, from his Comanche name of Haí-tsiki), and Â´dalpepte,
"Bushy-hair" (Frizzle-head), all being prominent men and noted warriors
when in their prime. T'ébodal is the oldest man in the tribe, and
as he was "a well grown boy when the stars fell," is consequently
now just about 80 years of age, as the Indians consider a boy a young
warrior at 17 or 18. Gaápiatañ is a few years younger, and Â´dalpepte
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
was "old enough, to ride a horse when the stars fell," so that we may
assume him to be now (1896) about 70 years of age. It will be noted
that, contrary to general opinion, Indians are not remarkably long-lived.</p>

<p>Graápiatañ's estimate seems to place the event farthest back in point
of time. He fixes it by "a very old woman," who died eleven winters
ago (1885), and whose father had told her that the treaty with the
Comanche was made thirty-three years before she was born. Âdalpepte
states that it was made "when his father was a young man." T'ébodal
says that it was before he was born, but that his father knew both
leaders who negotiated the peace, and that he himself knew the Comanche
leader, Päréiyä, as a very old man, who was afterward killed by
the Cheyenne at a time when T'ébodal was grown to manhood and had
already been to war. According to the Kiowa calendar, the allied
tribes made peace with the Cheyenne about 1840, so that the chief
who negotiated the treaty for the Comanche must have been killed
shortly before that time, the Kiowa leader, Guik`áte, being already
dead. Balancing all the statements, we get 1790 as the most probable
approximate date. The principal chief of the tribe at the time of the
treaty was Políakyă, "Harelip," alias Kágiätsé, "Thick-blanket." He
was succeeded by Tsóñbohón, "Feather-cap," who was succeeded by
A'dáte, "Island-man," who was deposed in 1833 in favor of Dohásän,
who thenceforth ruled the tribe until his death in 1866.</p>

<h4 id="CONFEDERATION_OF_THE_TWO_TRIBES">CONFEDERATION OF THE TWO TRIBES</h4>

<p>The peace thus made between the two tribes has never been broken,
in which fact there may be a sermon for those who regard the Indian as
faithless, when we consider how few European alliances have endured
as long. The Pénätĕka Comanche, who lived far down in Texas, were
not included in this compact and had very little connection even
with the northern bands of their own people until brought together
under the reservation system. Immediately after the treaty the Kiowa
began to move down and make their camps along and south of the
Arkansas, which, until that time, had been considered the northern
boundary of the Comanche country and the southern limit of the Kiowa
range. In the territory which they thenceforth held in common the
Kiowa usually made their home camps more to the northwest, about
the Arkansas, while the Comanche kept near to the Staked plains
and the Texas frontier. Strengthened by their alliance for war and
defense, the confederated tribes were now able to make a successful stand
behind the Arkansas against further invasion from the north. The raids
of the Kiowa on the Mexican settlements, hitherto desultory and ineffective,
now became constant and destructive and continued until both
tribes were finally subjugated and confined to their reservation after
the outbreak of 1874. In these raiding expeditions they frequently
made headquarters in the Sierra Madre, whence they descended upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
the lower country on each side. Old men are still living in the tribe
who have raided as far south as the city of Durango (which they know
by this name) and southwest through Sonora and Sinaloa to the Gulf of
California. These war parties would sometimes be absent two years.
To the west they reached the great Colorado river and tell of killing
some Havasupai in their canyon home. In the east they made captives
on Matagorda bay, Texas.</p>

<h4 id="NEUTRAL_ATTITUDE_OF_NEW_MEXICANS">NEUTRAL ATTITUDE OF NEW MEXICANS</h4>

<p>According to the Kiowa and Comanche, whose statements are confirmed
by abundant testimony from other sources, the inhabitants of
New Mexico, from mercenary motives, usually held themselves neutral
in this war on their brethren to the south. New Mexican <i>Comancheros</i>
and domesticated Pueblo Indians carried on a lucrative trade among
these tribes at the same time that Kiowa or Comanche war parties were
ravaging the southern provinces or selling horses and mules, taken in
these raids, to the inhabitants of Las Vegas and neighboring towns.
The lances and tomahawks used by their warriors were of Mexican
manufacture, more slender and graceful in design than those supplied
to the northern tribes by English and American traders. It was only
by such tacit connivance or active aid from the people of New Mexico
that these tribes were able to carry on an unceasing warfare of extermination
as far south as Tamaulipas and Durango in Mexico.</p>

<h4 id="RELATIONS_WITH_OTHER_SOUTHERN_TRIBES">RELATIONS WITH OTHER SOUTHERN TRIBES</h4>

<p>Subsequent to the treaty with the Comanche, and as a consequence
of it, the Kiowa made peace with the Mescalero Apache (<i>Ĕ´sikwita</i>),
with whom they had formerly been at enmity, having driven them
from the Staked plains into the mountains west of the Pecos. The
friendship, however, was somewhat precarious. They were also on
friendly terms with the Wichita and their associated tribes, the Waco,
Tawákoni, and Kichai. With the Caddo and the cannibal Tonkawa
to the east, and with the Navaho and Ute and presumably also the
Jicarilla Apache on the west, they were always at war. They usually
carried on a friendly trade with the neighboring Pueblos. Their relations
with the Apache of Arizona were too casual to be of a definite
nature. They were at war with the Osage until 1834. To all these
tribes the confederated Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache held but one
and the same relation after the alliance of about 1790.</p>

<h4 id="FIRST_OFFICIAL_AMERICAN_NOTICES_1805_1807">FIRST OFFICIAL AMERICAN NOTICES, 1805&mdash;1807</h4>

<p>The earliest official account of the Kiowa is given by the explorers
Lewis and Clark, who ascended the Missouri in 1804 and wintered
among the Mandan, before proceeding onward across the mountains
and down to the mouth of the Columbia. They do not appear to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
met any of the Kiowa, but heard of them from the tribes living on
the river. By that time the Kiowa, whom the explorers erroneously
supposed were distinct from the "Wetepahatoes," had been driven out
of the Black Hills, which were then in possession of the Cheyenne,
while the Dakota held the country to the eastward. The Kiowa were
then on the Padouca or North Platte. This agrees with the statements
of old men of the Dakota confederacy, who informed the writer that
within their early recollection that tribe had lived between the North
Platte and the Niobrara, having been expelled from the Black Hills by
the Dakota of the preceding generation.</p>

<p>The official report of Captain Lewis describes the Kiowa ("Kiawas"
and "Wetepahatoes") as living in 1805 on the North fork of the
Platte, and numbering 70 tipis, 200 warriors, and 700 souls, while the
Kiowa Apache ("Cataka") lived somewhat farther north, on the headwaters
of the two forks of Cheyenne river, and are estimated at 25
tipis, 75 warriors, and 300 souls. While the figures thus given for the
Apache are probably nearly correct, those for the Kiowa are much too
low, unless we assume that they had been so greatly reduced by the
war with the Dakota. The alliances and wars of the two tribes, Kiowa
and Apache, were the same, they carrying on a defensive war with the
Dakota and being at peace with all the other tribes of the region,
particularly with the Arikara, Mandan, and Hidatsa. The account
continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They are a wandering nation, inhabit an open country, and raise a great number
of horses, which they barter to the Ricaras, Mandans, etc, for articles of European
manufactory. They are a well-disposed people, and might be readily induced to
visit the trading establishments on the Missouri. From the animals their country
produces, their trade would no doubt become valuable. These people again barter a
considerable proportion of the articles they obtain from the Menetares, Ahwahhaways,
Mandans, and Ricaras to the Dotames and Castapanas.... Neither
these people ("Kiawas"), the Wetepahatoes, nor the Chyennes have any idea of
exclusive right to the soil (<cite>Lewis and Clark, 1</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Dotames and Castapanas (for Castahanas) here mentioned are
described as living back of the Kiowa, between the head streams of
the North Platte and the Yellowstone, and were probably bands of the
Shoshoni. From this it appears that besides being well supplied with
horses, with which they carried on a profitable trade at this period
with the tribes on the Missouri, the Kiowa also acted as the trading
medium between these tribes and others living in the mountains beyond
the Kiowa. The officer suggests the mouth of Cheyenne river as the
most suitable place to establish a trading post for them. The Crows
are described as having then the same wars and friendships as the
Kiowa, excepting that they were at war with the Arikara as well as
with the Dakota (<cite>Lewis and Clark, 2</cite>).</p>

<p>The Comanche are described at this period (1805) under the name of
the "La Playes" division of "Aliatans" or "Snake Indians," as inhabiting
the plains from the headwaters of the Arkansas, and including
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the sources of Red river, and extending from the mountains eastward
indefinitely. They were a wandering people, claiming no particular
boundaries, and, although possessing no guns, were brave and warlike.
Their country abounded in wild horses, besides great numbers which
they raised themselves (<cite>Lewis and Clark, 3</cite>).</p>

<p>In his volume published a few years later the explorer, Zebulon M.
Pike, states that the Kiowa, estimated by him to number 1,000 men,
had in 1803 been driven by the Dakota into the mountains on the
heads of the Platte and Arkansas and north of the Comanche, where
they were then wandering. They owned immense herds of horses, were
armed with bows, arrows, and lances, hunted the buffalo, and were at
war with the Dakota, Pawnee, and "Tetau" (here meaning the Ute). In
another place he mentions both Ute and Kiowa as living in the mountains
of northern Mexico&mdash;the present Colorado and New Mexico&mdash;the
former being more civilized from contact with the Spaniards. He
speaks also of meeting, in 1807, a party of Kiowa and Comanche
returning from a trading expedition to the Mandan (<cite>Pike, 1</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="EXPLANATION_OF_ALIATAN_AND_TETAU">EXPLANATION OF "ALIATAN" AND "TETAU"</h4>

<p>As the names Aliatan and Tetau here quoted from Lewis and Clark,
with their variants, have been the cause of much confusion in our western
tribal nomenclature, some explanation will not be out of place.
Although so unlike in appearance, these appellations are really but
different forms of the same word. The Ute of the mountain, region at
the headwaters of the Platte and the Arkansas, being a powerful and
aggressive tribe, were well known to all the Indians of the plains, who
usually called them by some form of their proper name, <i>Yútawáts</i>, or,
in its root form, <i>Yuta</i>, whence we get Eutaw, Utah, and Ute. Among
the Kiowa the name becomes <i>Íătä</i>(<i>-go</i>), while the Siouan tribes seem to
have nasalized it so that the early French traders wrote it as Ayutan,
Iatan, or Ietan. By prefixing the French article it became L'Iatan,
and afterward Aliatan, while by misreading of the manuscript word
we get Jatan, Jetan, and finally Tetau. Moreover, as the early traders
and explorers knew but little of the mountain tribes, they frequently
confounded those of the same generic stock, so that almost any of these
forms may mean Shoshoni, Ute, or Comanche, according to the general
context of the description.</p>

<h4 id="UNSUCCESSFUL_OVERTURES_OF_THE_DAKOTA">UNSUCCESSFUL OVERTURES OF THE DAKOTA</h4>

<p>As an incident of the war in progress during this period between the
Kiowa and the Dakota, we find it recorded on a calendar of the latter
tribe, under date of 1814&mdash;15, that a party of their people visited the
Kiowa camp on Horse creek for the purpose of making peace, but their
benevolent purpose was defeated by the occurrence of a sudden quarrel
between one of their own men and a Kiowa, which ended by the Dakota
sinking his tomahawk into the Kiowa's head, thus bringing the peace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
negotiations to an abrupt close (<cite>Mallery, 3</cite>). The story, which well
illustrates the uncertainty of Indian temper, has a striking parallel in
Grinnell's story of "The Peace with the Snakes" (<cite>Grinnell, Blackfoot, 1</cite>).
The Kiowa camp was at the junction of Kiowa creek with Horse creek,
which enters the North Platte from the south in Nebraska, just east of
the Wyoming line.</p>

<h4 id="SMALLPOX_EPIDEMIC_OF_1816">SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC OF 1816</h4>

<p>In 1816 the smallpox made terrible ravages among all the tribes in
the region of the Red and Rio Grande, being probably communicated
from the Spanish settlements. The Comanche especially lost heavily
(<cite>Morse, 1</cite>). The Kiowa suffered in proportion, and their old men speak
of this as the first epidemic of smallpox within the memory of their
tribe. It is probable, however, that they had suffered in the same
way some years before, for we know that in 1801 a Pawnee war party,
returning from New Mexico, brought the smallpox home with them,
with the result that it spread among the tribes from the Missouri to the
coast of Texas. The prairie tribes are said to have lost more than half
their population at this time, while the Wichita, Caddo, and others in
the south suffered almost as severely (<cite>Morse, 2</cite>; <cite>Lewis and Clark, 4</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="THE_KIOWA_IN_1820">THE KIOWA IN 1820</h4>

<p>In the account of his expedition up the Arkansas in 1820, Long speaks
of the Kiowa as wandering with the Arapaho and others over the prairies
of Arkansas and Red rivers, and having great numbers of horses,
which they traded to the Cheyenne and other northern Indians, who
were not able to rear them so easily in their colder and more barren
country. He describes a great gathering of tribes in 1815 on the South
Platte, apparently about the junction of Kiowa creek in Colorado, a
region which he mentions as frequented by the Kiowa, when the Cheyenne
came down with goods from the traders on the Missouri to meet
and trade for horses with the Kiowa, Arapaho, and "Kaskaia or Bad
Hearts," and a party of traders from St Louis (<cite>James, Long's Ex., 1</cite>).
This appears to be the first notice of the Kiowa as living on Red river&mdash;which,
however, may here mean the Canadian&mdash;and is evidence that
they were at this time on friendly terms with the Arapaho and Cheyenne,
with both of which tribes they were soon after at war. We learn
also from this notice that the St Louis traders had already begun to
come out to trade with them on the Arkansas, although none were
regularly established in their territory until some years later. The
"Kaskaias" are probably the Kiowa Apache, or possibly the Wichita.</p>

<h4 id="THE_OSAGE_MASSACRE_AND_THE_DRAGOON_EXPEDITION_1833_34">THE OSAGE MASSACRE AND THE DRAGOON EXPEDITION&mdash;1833&mdash;34</h4>

<p>We come now to the period covered by the Kiowa calendars, the first
important event of which is the massacre of a large number of the
tribe by a war party of Osage in the early spring of 1833. This led
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
indirectly to the expedition of the First dragoons in 1834, by which
the Kiowa, Comanche, Wichita, and associated tribes were first
brought into official relations with the United States. The massacre
and the expedition will be found treated at length in the proper place.
When the troops returned to Fort Gibson, in the eastern part of
Indian Territory, in August, they were accompanied by a party of one
Waco, one Comanche, three Wichita, and fifteen Kiowa chiefs or headmen,
of whom the artist Catlin says they were undoubtedly one of the
most interesting groups that had ever visited the frontier. Invitations
were sent out to the chiefs of all the neighboring tribes to come in
to Fort Gibson and meet their visitors from the west. A number
responded, and a council lasting several days was held under the auspices
of Colonel Dodge of the Dragoons, Indian Agent Major Armstrong,
and Indian Commissioner General Stokes, which paved the
way for a friendly understanding between the eastern and western
tribes, and for both with regard to the United States (<cite>Catlin, 1</cite>).</p>

<p>A year later, in August, 1835, as a result of the friendly relations
thus established, the chiefs of the Comanche and Wichita met the
United States commissioners at Camp Holmes, about 5 miles northeast
of the present site of Purcell, Indian Territory, and made their first
treaty with the government. The principal stipulation was that there
should be peace and friendship between the Comanche and Wichita
on the one hand, and the United States, Creek, Cherokee, and other
immigrant tribes, and the Osage on the other (<cite>Treaties</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="THE_TREATY_OF_1837">THE TREATY OF 1837</h4>

<p>Owing to a delay in the negotiations, the Kiowa who had attended
the meeting became impatient and returned home and consequently
were not parties to this treaty, but two years later a full delegation of
Kiowa, Apache, and Tawakoni went down to Fort Gibson, where the
first treaty between the United States and these tribes was made on
May 26, 1837, and was formally ratified the following year. In the
document the three tribes are called "the Kioway, Ka-ta-ka, and
Ta-wa-karo nations of Indians." The general terms of the treaty are
the same as in that previously made with the Comanche and Wichita,
namely, peace and friendship, with forgiveness of past injuries, and
satisfactory settlement of future disputes that might arise between
these western tribes and the Osage, Muscogee (Creek), and citizens of
the United States. All the tribes concerned were to have equal hunting
rights on the southern prairies as far west as the jurisdiction of the
government extended, and citizens of the United States were to have
free right of travel to and from Mexico and Texas through the Indian
hunting grounds.</p>

<p>There was also a stipulation that if "any of the red people belonging
to the nations or tribes of Indians residing south of the Missouri river
and west of the states of Missouri and Arkansas, not parties to this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
treaty," should be found in the country of the Kiowa, they should be
kindly treated by them. This was probably intended to refer only to
the immigrant tribes removed from the east, as it was hardly to be
expected that the Kiowa would act very hospitably toward any stray
Dakota or Pawnee who might occasionally visit the Arkansas in search
of Kiowa scalps or ponies. There was also a distinct understanding
that it was the desire of the government that perfect peace should
exist between the Kiowa and their allies and the republics of Mexico
and Texas. The usual presents were then distributed and everybody
was happy (<cite>Treaties</cite>).</p>

<p>The peace thus made with the Osage and Creeks was never broken,
although in after years relations with the Osage were somewhat strained
in consequence of their serving as scouts against the allied southern
plains tribes. The promised friendship was also kept with regard to
the citizens of the United States until after the annexation of Texas,
which the Kiowa and Comanche never ceased to regard as a distinct
and hostile government, making a clear distinction between "Americans,"
i. e., settlers and emigrants from the north or Kansas side, and
"Texans," whom they regarded as a different nation and their enemies,
in having driven them from their best hunting grounds in violation of
treaties and without compensation.</p>

<p>The treaty commissioners on behalf of the government were General
Montfort Stokes and A. P. Chouteau, the latter being a member of the
noted pioneer trading company. Clermont and Roly McIntosh, head
chiefs of the Osage and Creeks, signed, with others, for their respective
tribes. Among the witnesses were a number of officers, stationed at
Fort Gibson, including, among others, the commanding officer, Colonel
Whistler, the noted Captain Bonneville, and Colonel R. L. Dodge, who
had led the dragoon expedition. The treaty was signed by ten Kiowa
chiefs and principal men, three Apache (whose Kiowa names only are
given), and four Tawakoni. Below are given the names of the Kiowa
and Apache, as the earliest on record from these tribes, excepting those
given by Catlin, together with the proper forms and translations of
those which can be identified.</p>

<p>At this time the Kiowa were located on the upper waters of Arkansas,
Canadian, and Red rivers, in friendship with the Comanche and Wichita,
who occupied much of the same territory, but usually ranged more to
the east and south. They continued to occupy the same general region
until confined to their present reservation. Their war parties extended
their raids far beyond these limits, particularly toward the south.</p>

<h4 id="CATLINS_OBSERVATIONS_IN_1834">CATLIN'S OBSERVATIONS IN 1834</h4>

<p>Catlin, who saw them in 1834, describes them as a much finer race of
men than either the Comanche or Wichita, being tall and erect, with
an easy graceful gait, long hair reaching often nearly to the ground,
with a fine Roman outline of head, of a type common among the northern
tribes, but entirely distinct from that usually found in the south
(<cite>Catlin, 2</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="TRADERS_AMONG_THE_KIOWA">TRADERS AMONG THE KIOWA</h4>

<p>From the statement of Lewis and Clark already noted, it appears
that in 1805, while still located on the North Platte, the Kiowa had as
yet no communication with traders, but obtained supplies indirectly
through the tribes living farther east. From Pike's narrative, however,
we learn that James Pursley, "the first American who ever penetrated
the immense wilds of Louisiana," spent a trading season with the
Kiowa and Comanche in 1802 or 1803, under engagement with a French
trader operating from the Mandan country, and remained with them
until the next spring, when the Dakota drove them from the plains into
the mountains at the heads of the Platte and Arkansas (<cite>Pike, 2</cite>). From
Long's statement, also previously quoted, we learn that in 1815, the
Kiowa having drifted farther south in the meantime, traders from St
Louis had begun to ascend Arkansas river to trade with the Kiowa,
Cheyenne, and other tribes near its headwaters. From other sources
it is apparent that before this time they had had dealings also with the
Spaniards of New Mexico. The first regular American trading expedition
to the Kiowa country was made in 1834 when, on the return of
the visiting chiefs from Fort Gibson, a company of eighty trappers and
traders went back with them to their homes on the upper Washita and
Red rivers (<cite>Catlin, 3</cite>). In 1835, shortly after the treaty with the
Comanche at Camp Holmes, Colonel Auguste Chouteau built on the
same site a small stockade fort, where a considerable trade was carried
on with the Comanche, Kiowa, Wichita, and associated tribes until his
death three years later, when the place was abandoned (<cite>Gregg, 1</cite>). The
exact location of Camp Holmes and Chouteau's fort was at a spring on
a small creek, both still bearing the name of Chouteau, on the east or
north side of South (main) Canadian river, about 5 miles northeast of
where now is the town of Purcell, Indian Territory. It was a favorite
Indian camping ground and was the site of a Kichai village about 1850.</p>

<p>Auguste Chouteau, the descendant of one of the early French
founders of St Louis, was the pioneer organizer of the Indian trade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
in the upper Red river country, as were the Bents, also of French
origin, on the upper Arkansas. Under the name of <i>Soto</i>, Chouteau is
still held in affectionate remembrance by the Kiowa.</p>

<p>Chouteau's fort on the Canadian was considered to be in Comanche
territory. Shortly after the treaty with the Kiowa in 1837, he established
what they regard as the first trading post within their own
country, on the west bank of Cache creek, about 3 miles below the
present Fort Sill, Oklahoma. <i>Tomé-te</i> (Thomas?) is the name by which
the Kiowa remember the trader in charge, who, however, did not
remain long. Another store was established nearly on the same ground
by William Madison (<i>Sénpo-zédalbe</i>, "Terrible-beard") in 1869, after
the tribes had been assigned to a reservation. In 1844, William Bent
began building trading posts on the South Canadian, in the Texas
panhandle, near the principal Kiowa trails. They also traded extensively
at various points on the Arkansas until their final removal to
Indian Territory.</p>

<h4 id="FIRST_VISIT_TO_FORT_GIBSON">FIRST VISIT TO FORT GIBSON</h4>

<p>With the treaty of 1837 and the building of the first trading post in
their country, the modern history of the Kiowa may be said to have
fairly begun. Their first introduction to American civilization was in
1834, when Dohásän and the other chiefs accompanied the troops back
to Fort Gibson, and again in 1837 when they went to the same place
for the purpose of making the treaty. Soon afterward arrangements
were made by Colonel Chouteau to have a delegation of Kiowa,
Comanche, and their associated tribes visit Washington and other
eastern cities. A party of chiefs visited Fort Gibson for this purpose
in the summer of 1839, but Colonel Chouteau having died during the
previous winter, and the season being then far advanced, it was deemed
best to abandon the trip, and accordingly they were given some presents
and returned to their homes (<cite>Report, 1</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="SMALLPOX_EPIDEMIC_OF_1839_40_PEACE_WITH_THE_CHEYENNE_AND_ARAPAHO">SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC OF 1839&mdash;40&mdash;PEACE WITH THE CHEYENNE AND ARAPAHO</h4>

<p>In the winter of 1839&mdash;40 the Kiowa again suffered from the smallpox,
which had broken out in the north in the summer of 1837, nearly exterminating
the Mandan, and then swept the whole plains to the gulf. In
1840 they made peace with the Arapaho and Cheyenne, with whom they
have ever since been on terms of intimate friendship (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).
They had already made peace with the Dakota, so that they
were now on good terms with all the tribes of the plains excepting the
Pawnee and Tonkawa, who seem always to have been outlawed tribes,
without friends or allies.</p>

<h4 id="TEXAN_SANTA_FE_EXPEDITION">TEXAN SANTA FÉ EXPEDITION</h4>

<p>In 1841 the Texan Santa Fé expedition passed through the country of
the Kiowa. Kendall, the historian of that ill-fated undertaking, describes
the tribe as occupying the prairies near the headwaters of Colorado,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Brazos, Wichita, and Red rivers, and incorrectly supposes that their
hunting grounds had never before been visited by white men. He says
that they seemed to be a powerful people, hitherto but little known,
owing to the fact that their range was south of the line of the Missouri
traders and north of that portion of the Comanche country with which
the Texans were acquainted. He speaks of their extraordinary horsemanship,
and credits them with the feat, ascribed also to other plains
tribes, of throwing themselves to one side of their horses while riding
parallel with their enemies in such a way as to conceal and protect their
bodies while discharging their arrows directly under their horses' necks.
They had then but few guns, and these were ineffective in their hands,
but were surprisingly expert in the use of shields, bows, and lances
(<cite>Kendall, 1</cite>). The disastrous encounter of the Texans with the tribe is
narrated in the proper place.</p>

<h4 id="CHOLERA_EPIDEMIC_OF_1849">CHOLERA EPIDEMIC OF 1849</h4>

<p>The next notable event in Kiowa history is the cholera epidemic of
1849. It was brought from the east by California emigrants, and
ravaged all the tribes of the plains. The Kiowa remember it as the
most terrible experience in their history, far exceeding in fatality
the smallpox of nine years before. Hundreds died and many committed
suicide in their despair (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<h4 id="FORT_ATKINSON_TREATY_IN_1853">FORT ATKINSON TREATY IN 1853</h4>

<p>For years the Kiowa and their confederates had been carrying on a
chronic warfare against Mexico and Texas, although generally friendly
toward Americans on the north. For the protection of the advancing
settlements and the traffic over the Santa Fé trail, now amounting to
over $2,000,000 annually (<cite>Report, 2</cite>), it was deemed necessary to end
this anomalous condition of affairs. Accordingly, on July 27, 1853, a
treaty was negotiated by agent Thomas Fitzpatrick, at Fort Atkinson,
on the Arkansas, in Kansas, with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache,
by which these tribes agreed to remain at peace with both the United
States and Mexico, and conceded the right of the government to establish
roads and military posts within their territory. In return for these
concessions, they were to receive an annuity of $18,000 for a term of
ten years, subject to a further extension of five years (<cite>Treaties</cite>). It
is somewhat remarkable that this treaty is not noted on the calendar,
neither does it seem to form a subject of conversation among the
older men.</p>

<h4 id="DEPREDATIONS_IN_MEXICO_MEXICAN_CAPTIVES">DEPREDATIONS IN MEXICO&mdash;MEXICAN CAPTIVES</h4>

<p>Although for obvious reasons the Indians were opposed to the establishment
of roads and military posts in their country, the chief difficulty
in the way of a treaty was their unwillingness to cease war on
Mexico. The proposition to restore their Mexican captives met a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
prompt and decided refusal. As the Mexican captive element forms
so large a proportion of the blood of these three tribes, the remarks of
agent Fitzpatrick in this connection are of interest:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The chief difficulty which occurred in negotiating the present treaty was not,
however, presented in the article embracing the foregoing points, but in that which
contemplates a cessation of hostilities against the neighboring provinces of Mexico
and the restoration of prisoners hereafter captured. For a long time these tribes
have been in the habit of replenishing their caballadas of horses from the rich valleys
and pasture lands which border upon the Rio Grande. Yearly incursions have
been made by them far into the interior of Chihuahua and Durango, and they but
seldom return without having acquired much plunder, as well as many captives,
from the defenseless inhabitants of that country. The name of the Comanche and
Apache has become a byword of terror even in the villages and beneath the city
walls of those fertile provinces. The consequences of those expeditions are twofold,
for while they serve to sharpen the appetite for pillage and rapine, they also tend to
keep up the numbers of the tribe. The large herds driven off produce the former
result, and the prisoners captured contribute to the latter. The males thus taken
are most commonly adopted into the tribe, and soon become the most expert leaders
of war parties and the most accomplished of marauders. The females are chosen as
wives and share the duties and pleasures of the lodge. In fact, so intermingled
amongst these tribes have the most of the Mexican captives become that it is somewhat
difficult to distinguish them. They sit in council with them, hunt with them,
go to war with them, and partake of their perils and profits, and but few have any
desire to leave them. Upon this account the chiefs of the nations refused positively
and distinctly to entertain any proposals or make any treaties having in view giving
up those captives now dwelling amongst them. They stated very briefly that
they had become a part of the tribe; that they were identified with them in all
their modes of life; that they were the husbands of their daughters and the mothers
of their children, and they would never consent to a separation, nor could any persuasion
or inducement move them to abate this position. All that could be accomplished
was to make a provision for the future (<cite>Report, 3</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Even this much, seems to have amounted to but little, for in the next
year we find the same agent-reporting that "so far as I can learn, they
have faithfully complied with the treaty stipulations, save one. It is a
difficult matter to make them understand that New Mexico now belongs
to the United States. They deny ever having consented not to war on
Mexicans. They say that they have no other place to get their horses
and mules from" (<cite>Report, 4</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="DEFEAT_OF_ALLIED_TRIBES_BY_SAUK_AND_FOX_1854">DEFEAT OF ALLIED TRIBES BY SAUK AND FOX, 1854</h4>

<p>In the summer of 1854 the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne,
and others of the plains tribes, organized a great expedition for the
purpose of exterminating the immigrant tribes in eastern Kansas,
whose presence was beginning to be felt in an ominous decrease of the
buffalo. Although this was perhaps the largest war party ever raised
by the plains Indians south of the Sioux country, being estimated to
number 1,500 warriors, they were ingloriously defeated with heavy
loss by a party of Sauk and Fox numbering hardly a hundred, the
result being due to the fact that the latter were armed with long-range
rifles, while their enemies had only bows and arrows. Almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
every old man of the Kiowa now alive was in this battle, which is
famous among all the tribes of the southern plains (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<p>In the same year, according to Clark, a party of 113 Pawnee was
cut off and slaughtered almost to a man by an overwhelming force of
Cheyenne and Kiowa (<cite>Clark, 19</cite>). There is no record of this engagement
on the calendars, although several minor encounters with the
Pawnee are noted about this time.</p>

</div>

<p>In the next few years we find little of importance recorded of the
Kiowa beyond concurrent statements of both military and civil
officials that they were growing constantly more insolent and
unmanageable. In 1856 a war party of nearly one hundred arrived at
Albuquerque, New Mexico, having passed through the center of the
settlements of that territory, on their way to attack the Navaho.
They were turned back by the military commander, committing several
depredations as they retired (<cite>Report, 5</cite>). Two years later another
large war party, together with some Cheyenne, passed Fort Garland,
Colorado, almost on the great divide, in pursuit of the Ute (<i>Report,
6</i>).</p>

<h4 id="DEFIANT_SPEECH_OF_DOHASAN">DEFIANT SPEECH OF DOHÁSÄN</h4>

<p>On one occasion, during
the distribution of the annuity goods on the Arkansas, when fifteen
hundred lodges of Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache
were encamped along the river, the agent took the opportunity to tell
the Kiowa as plainly as possible that if they did not cease their depredations
the government would not only withhold their presents but
would send troops to punish them. The great chief Dohásän, after
listening in respectful silence to the end, sprang to his feet, and, calling
the attention of the agent to the hundreds of tipis in the valley below,
replied in a characteristic speech:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The white chief is a fool. He is a coward. His heart is small&mdash;not larger than a
pebble stone. His men are not strong&mdash;too few to contend against my warriors.
They are women. There are three chiefs&mdash;the white chief, the Spanish chief, and
myself. The Spanish chief and myself are men. We do bad toward each other
sometimes, stealing horses and taking scalps, but we do not get mad and act the
fool. The white chief is a child, and like a child gets mad quick. When my young
men, to keep their women and children from starving, take from the white man
passing through our country, killing and driving away our buffalo, a cup of sugar or
coffee, the white chief is angry and threatens to send his soldiers. I have looked
for them a long time, but they have not come. He is a coward. His heart is a
woman's. I have spoken. Tell the great chief what I have said (<cite>Report, 7</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="SMALLPOX_EPIDEMIC_OF_1861_62">SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC OF 1861&mdash;62</h4>

<p>In the winter of 1861&mdash;62 the smallpox, brought back from New Mexico
by a party of Kiowa returning from a trading trip, again ravaged
the Kiowa, Comanche, and other tribes of the plains (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).
To prevent a recurrence of the disease, the government soon
afterward took measures for vaccinating the western Indians. In the
summer of 1863 a delegation of Kiowa visited Washington and gave
permission for the establishment of mail stations along the roads
through their country in southeastern Colorado (<cite>Report, 8</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="INDIAN_WAR_ON_THE_PLAINS_1864">INDIAN WAR ON THE PLAINS, 1864</h4>

<p>The chronic raiding still continued. In 1860 the troops had been
ordered to chastise the Kiowa and Comanche, but apparently with
little effect. Then came the rebellion, involving all the civilized and
partly civilized tribes of the south and reacting on the wild tribes of
the plains. At the same time the fugitive hostiles from the Sioux war
in Minnesota in 1862, who had taken refuge with their western brethren
of the same tribe, helped to increase the ferment. There is evidence
also that agents of the Confederacy had something to do with this
result. In the fall of 1863 it was learned that a combination had been
formed by the Dakota, Cheyenne, part of the Arapaho, the Kiowa,
Comanche, and Apache&mdash;all the principal fighting tribes&mdash;to inaugurate
a general war along the plains in the spring. To meet the emergency,
messages were sent out to the different tribes in June, 1864,
directing all friendly Indians to repair at once to certain designated
military posts, with a warning that all found away from these posts
after a certain date would be considered hostile. As it was difficult
for troops to distinguish one tribe from another, an order was issued
at the same time prohibiting the friendly Indians in eastern Kansas
from going out on their usual buffalo hunt upon the plains.</p>

<p>Only a part of the Arapaho, and later some of the Cheyenne,
responded and came in. After waiting a sufficient time, Governor
Evans of Colorado issued a proclamation in the summer of 1864 designating
all Indians remaining out as hostiles, whom all persons were
authorized to kill and destroy as enemies of the country, wherever
they might be found (<cite>Report, 9</cite>). In August the agent at Fort Lyon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
Colorado, for the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho,
wrote that "the orders are to kill every Indian found in the country,
and I am inclined to assist in carrying the orders into effect"
(<cite>Report, 10</cite>).</p>

<p>The official reports covering the summer of 1864 are full of notices of
murders and depredations on the plains. The agent of the Overland
Mail stated in August that as a consequence the company had been
compelled to abandon all its stations for a distance of 400 miles, while
every ranch within the same section had been deserted. He reported
that the Indians "arrogantly declare that the land belongs exclusively
to them; they intend to regain and hold it if they have to destroy every
white man, woman, and child to accomplish their purpose. It would
seem that the recent enormous emigration across the plains has alarmed
many of the tribes and infused into their rude minds the belief that
the whites were about to take possession of their country" (<cite>Report, 11</cite>).
The great emigration referred to was in consequence of the rush to the
gold mines of Pike's Peak, discovered in 1858.</p>

<h4 id="VACCINATION_AMONG_THE_PLAINS_TRIBES_SET-TAINTE">VACCINATION AMONG THE PLAINS TRIBES&mdash;SET-T'AIÑTE</h4>

<p>As usual, the Indians had deferred hostilities until the grass was
high enough in the spring to enable their ponies to travel. In April a
government physician, who had been sent among these tribes to vaccinate
them as a protection from the smallpox which had recently decimated
them, as already noted, found them all apparently friendly.
From him we have an interesting description of the appearance and
home life of the famous chief Set-t'aiñte. He writes from Fort Larned:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have been two weeks among the Kiowas, about 40 miles up the Arkansas river.
I was four days in Satana's [<i>Set-t'aiñte</i>] or White Bear's village, who is, I believe,
their principal chief. He is a fine-looking Indian, very energetic, and as sharp as a
brier. He and all his people treated, me with much friendship. I ate my meals
regularly three times a day with him in his lodge. He puts on a good deal of style,
spreads a carpet for his guests to sit on, and has painted fireboards 20 inches wide
and 3 feet long, ornamented with bright brass tacks driven all around the edges,
which they use for tables. He has a brass French horn, which he blew vigorously
when the meals were ready. I slept with Yellow Buffalo, who was one of the chiefs
that visited Washington with Major Colley. They have quite a number of cows and
calves and a good many oxen and some mules and American horses that they say
they stole from Texas. A body of Kiowas and Comanches and some Cheyennes
intend to make another raid into Texas in about five or six weeks.</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be remembered that Texas was at this time in armed rebellion
against the general government, a fact which confirmed the Indians in
their belief that Texans and Americans were two distinct and hostile
nations. With correct prophecy the doctor surmises that a successful
result in the contemplated raid will encourage them to try their hand
farther north. By this time he had vaccinated nearly all the Indians
of the upper Arkansas (<cite>Report, 12</cite>). Fort Larned, in western Kansas,
was then the distributing point for the goods furnished by the government
to the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache.

<h4 id="THE_LITTLE_ARKANSAS_TREATY_IN_1865">THE LITTLE ARKANSAS TREATY IN 1865</h4>

<p>In a few months the grass was up and a change came o'er the spirit
of the dream. Hostilities had begun on the plains, and in order that
the innocent might not be punished with the guilty, the friendly tribes
along the eastern border had been forbidden to go out into the buffalo
country. This deprivation of accustomed privileges naturally caused
great dissatisfaction among the friendly Indians, who had come to
depend on their annual buffalo hunt to eke out their scanty food supply,
and they complained bitterly that the government had been feeding and
clothing the hostiles, while they themselves had been left to starve.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
In a strong letter their agent writes that, while he has a desire to shield
all Indians from wrong and severe treatment, yet "lead, and plenty of
it, is what the Kiowas want and must have before they will behave."
He denounces them as murderous thieves, and says that he has had
personal experience of their insolence and outrages (<cite>Report, 13</cite>). The
incidents of this war noted on the calendar are the encounter at Fort
Larned, in which the Kiowa ran off the horses of the soldiers, and the
attack on a Kiowa camp by a detachment of troops and Ute Indians
under command of Kit Carson (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<p>From the agent's report it appears that the Indians had begun hostilities
in the summer simultaneously on the Platte and the Arkansas, and
up to September had killed a number of people and run off several thousand
head of horses, mules, and cattle. Communication between the Colorado
settlements and the Missouri had been almost entirely cut off, the
overland coaches had to be supplied with large escorts, and emigrant
trains were compelled to combine for safety. It was thought that all the
tribes of the plains were on the warpath together. The Indians were
well mounted, knew the whole country perfectly, and so far, in every
contest on anything like equal terms, had proven themselves a match
for the white soldiers. As nearly the whole available force of the
government was then employed in suppressing the rebellion, no additional
troops could be sent to the frontier, and Governor Evans of
Colorado asked and received permission to raise a force of volunteers
against the hostiles. It was the opinion of many persons, including
army officers stationed in the country, that the whole trouble might
have been averted had the Indians been properly treated by the
whites (<cite>Report, 14</cite>).</p>

<p>In spite of the serious condition of affairs it was evident that the
chiefs did not want war. Early in September peace overtures were
received from the Cheyenne and Arapaho, who soon after came in and
camped as directed near Fort Lyon, Colorado. A month later the
agent reported that the Kiowa and Comanche had committed no depredations
for a long time and were supposed then to be south of the
Arkansas, near the Texas border (<cite>Report, 15</cite>). Before the trouble
began they had been encamped on the Arkansas, near Fort Larned.
As the tribes had now expressed their desire for peace, a commission
was sent out early in 1865 to meet them for that purpose. The commissioners
met the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache on August 15 at the
mouth of the Little Arkansas, where now is the town of Wichita,
Kansas, and received their promise to cease hostilities and to meet the
same commission in October to make a regular treaty of peace. Three
days later the Cheyenne and Arapaho entered into a similar agreement
at the same place. The Kiowa chiefs signing the agreement were
Dohásän as head chief, Gúi-pä´go ("Lone-wolf"), Sét-dayâ´-ite ("Many-bears"),
Set-t'aiñte ("White-bear"), Te'né-angópte ("Kicking-bird"),
and Set-ĭmkía ("Pushing-bear," commonly known as Stumbling-bear),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
with Sét-tádal ("Lean-bear") for the Apache, and eight of the Comanche.
Credit for this result is due largely to the efforts of agent
Leavenworth, who secured a suspension of military operations while he
went out to bring in the Indians, a matter of peculiar difficulty in
view of their fresh recollection of the massacre of friendly Cheyenne by
Colonel Chivington in the autumn of the preceding year (<cite>Report, 16</cite>).</p>

<p>Pursuant to agreement, commissioners met the five tribes in October,
1865, at the mouth of the Little Arkansas, where treaties were made
with the Cheyenne and Arapaho on the 14th, with the Apache on the
17th, and with the Kiowa and Comanche on the 18th. By the treaty
with the Apache they were officially detached from the Kiowa and
Comanche and attached to the Cheyenne and Arapaho, who agreed to
relinquish their reservation in southeastern Colorado for one farther
south, in Kansas and Indian Territory. The Kiowa and Comanche
agreed to remove south of the Arkansas, the reservation proposed for
their future home being a tract in western Texas and Oklahoma, as
follows: Commencing on the Canadian river where the eastern line of
New Mexico crosses the same; thence running south along said line
to the southern boundary of New Mexico; thence in a northeastwardly
direction to the headwaters of Big Wichita river; thence down
said river to its mouth or its junction with Red river; thence due
north to Canadian river; thence up the Canadian to the place of beginning.
By this treaty, which was intended, to be only temporary, they
gave up all claims in Colorado, Kansas, and New Mexico, and were
restricted to southwestern Oklahoma and the region of the Staked
plain in Texas. Five white captives were surrendered by the Kiowa
and Comanche at the same time (<cite>Treaty</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="DEATH_OF_DOHASAN">DEATH OF DOHÁSÄN</h4>

<p>In the course of the talk Dohásän, on behalf of his people, made a
vigorous protest against being confined to a reservation, claiming that
the Kiowa owned from Fort Laramie and the North Platte to Texas
and had always owned it, and that he did not want his country cut
up and divided with other tribes or given to the white man; his people
wanted a large country to roam over; they did not want to stay
long in one place, but wanted to move about; the Santa Fé road was
open and would not be disturbed, but the rest of their country he
wanted let alone. Notwithstanding this protest the treaty was signed.
Among others officially present were Kit Carson, William Bent, and
Agent Leavenworth, with William Shirley and Jesse Chisholm as
interpreters (<cite>Report, 17</cite>). Dohásän died shortly afterward, early in
1866, and with his death began the rapid decline of the Kiowa tribe.
He was succeeded by Gúi-pä´go, "Lone-wolf," adopted father of the
present chief of the same name. But the Indian day was drawing to a
close. Within a few years the Kiowa were practically prisoners on a
reservation, and their chiefs were the creatures of petty factions and
mere figureheads in the hands of the government.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<h4 id="KIOWA_RAIDS_CONTINUED">KIOWA RAIDS CONTINUED</h4>

<p>As a result of these peaceful efforts, there were but few reports of
disturbances during the next year, excepting from the incorrigible Kiowa.
Notwithstanding all their promises, Set-t'aiñte led a war party into
Texas and returned with five captives, a woman and four children,
whom he brought into Fort Larned for ransom. The agent sharply
reminded him of his promise to cease such acts, and demanded the
surrender of the prisoners without compensation, whereon, under pretense
of consulting the other chiefs, Set-t'aiñte  took them to Fort Dodge,
where the commander, compassionating their condition, rescued them
for a large sum. In reporting the circumstance, their agent urges that
it is high time the Kiowa were made to feel the strong arm of the government
as the only means of bringing them to a sense of their duty,
as they even went so far as to boast that stealing white women was a
more lucrative business than stealing horses (<cite>Report, 18</cite>).</p>

<p>Other complaints came in during the next year, but full investigation
by the military authorities satisfied them that with the exception of
this raid by Set-t'aiñte the Kiowa and Comanche were innocent (<i>Report,
19</i>). Accordingly measures were taken to arrange a meeting with
these tribes to establish more definite treaty relations, as contemplated
in the provisional treaty of 1865. Preliminary to this meeting Agent
Labadi, with a small party, went from Santa Fé across to the Texas
border, where he met a large portion of the confederated tribes and
urged on them the necessity of keeping peace with the government, at
the same time demanding the free surrender of all white captives of
the United States held by them, concluding by telling them that all of
their tribes hereafter found north of the Arkansas would be treated as
hostiles. After a conference among themselves, the chiefs agreed to
deliver up the captives and end all difficulties, and arranged for a full
meeting later, when some absent chiefs should have returned. In
regard to the raids into Texas, they distinctly stated that they had
been told by the military officers of the government to do all the damage
they could to Texas, because Texas was at war with the United
States (referring to the recent rebellion), and that until now they
were ignorant that peace had been established. Although it is pretty
certain that some of them at least had already been told that the rebellion
was at an end, yet there can be no doubt that the peculiar relations
which from the very beginning had existed between Texas and the
general government furnished them a plausible excuse for the depredations
(<cite>Report, 20</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="THE_TREATY_OF_MEDICINE_LODGE_1867_AND_ITS_RESULTS">THE TREATY OF MEDICINE LODGE, 1867, AND ITS RESULTS</h4>

<p>The result of these negotiations was the treaty of Medicine Lodge
on October 21, 1867, by which the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache were
officially confederated and agreed to come upon their present reservation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
(see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>). This treaty merits extended notice, inasmuch
as it changed the whole status of the Kiowa and their allies from that
of independent tribes with free and unrestricted range over the whole
plains to that of pensioners dependent on the government, confined to
the narrow limits of a reservation and subject to constant military and
civilian supervision. For them it marks the beginning of the end.
Moreover, on the provisions and promises of this treaty are based all
the arguments for and against the late unratified agreement of 1892.
It will be necessary first to review the situation.</p>

<p>For a number of years the Indian problem on the plains had been
constantly growing more serious. The treatment accorded by Texas
to her native and border tribes had resulted in driving them northward
to the country of upper Red river and the vicinity of the Santa Fé
trail, where they were a constant menace both to the trading caravans
and to the frontier settlers of Kansas and Colorado. In addition to
the old Santa Fé trail the thousands of emigrants to California and
Oregon had established regular roads across the plains, in the north
along the North Platte and in the south along the base of the Staked
plain, while the discovery of gold in Colorado in 1858 brought a flood
of white settlement into the very heart of the Indian country, driving
away the buffalo and narrowing the range of the tribes. Encroachments
and reprisals were becoming chronic, and it was evident that
some arrangement must be made by which the wild tribes could be
assigned a territory remote from the line of settlement and travel,
where they might roam and hunt undisturbed, without danger of coming
into collision with the whites.</p>

<p>The conditions a few years previous are well summed up by the
veteran trader William Bent, at that time agent for the Cheyenne and
Arapaho, in an official report dated October 5, 1859. In it he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes scrupulously maintain peaceful relations with
the whites and with other Indian tribes, notwithstanding the many causes of irritation
growing out of the occupation of the gold region, and the emigration to it
through their hunting grounds, which are no longer reliable as a certain source of
food to them. These causes precipitate the necessity of immediate and sufficient
negotiations for the safety of the whites, the emigrant roads, and the Indians....</p>

<p>The Kiowa and Comanche Indians have for two years appeared in full numbers
and for long periods upon the Arkansas, and now permanently occupy the country
between the Canadian and Arkansas rivers. This is in consequence of the hostile
front opposed to them in Texas, by which they are forced toward the north, and is
likely to continue perpetual.... A smothered passion for revenge agitates these
Indians, perpetually fomented by the failure of food, the encircling encroachments
of the white population, and the exasperating sense of decay and impending extinction
with which they are surrounded....</p>

<p>I estimate the number of whites traversing the plains across the center belt to
have exceeded sixty thousand during the present season. The trains of vehicles and
cattle are frequent and valuable in proportion. Post lines and private expresses are
in constant motion. The explorations of this season have established the existence
of the precious metals in absolutely infinite abundance and convenience of position.
The concourse of whites is therefore constantly swelling and incapable of control or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
restraint by the government. This suggests the policy of promptly rescuing the
Indians and withdrawing them from contact with the whites, as the element capable
of such immediate management as may anticipate and prevent difficulties and
massacre. I repeat, then, as the suggestion of my best judgment, that immediate
and sufficient steps be taken to assemble and finally dispose of these particular tribes
of Indians, viz, the Kiowa and Comanches, the Cheyennes, and the Arapahoes, by
reducing them, under treaties and arrangements, to become agricultural and pastoral
people, located within specific districts, judiciously selected and liberally endowed,
to which they shall be restricted and the white men excluded from among them.
These numerous and warlike Indians, pressed upon all around by the Texans, by the
settlers of the gold region, by the advancing people of Kansas and from the Platte,
are already compressed into a small circle of territory, destitute of food, and itself
bisected athwart by a constantly marching line of emigrants. A desperate war of
starvation and extinction is therefore imminent and inevitable unless prompt measures
shall prevent it (<cite>Report, 21</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite this warning no steps were taken toward a remedy, and in
April, 1864, the irritation resulted in a war with the Cheyenne, speedily
involving also the Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, with
several bands of the Dakota. The most memorable incident of this
war was the massacre of 120 friendly Cheyenne, encamped under the
protection of the United States flag, near Fort Lyon, on Sand creek,
Colorado, by Colorado militia under Colonel Chivington, on November
29, 1864. Hostilities ended with treaties made with the five tribes
chiefly concerned at the mouth of the Little Arkansas (now Wichita,
Kansas), in October, 1865, as already noted. Short as the war had
been, it had cost the government over $30,000,000 and an unknown
number of lives (<cite>Report, 22</cite>).</p>

<p>From this time the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, as tribes,
remained quiet, according to the terms of the treaty, but it was otherwise
with the more northern Indians, who found themselves subjected
to constant aggressions in spite of all agreements. In July, 1866, a
war broke out with the Sioux, and in April, 1867, it spread to the
Cheyenne and Arapaho. Leading incidents of these campaigns were
the massacre of Lieutenant-Colonel Fetterman's whole command at
Fort Phil. Kearney, December 21, 1866, and the burning of a large
Cheyenne village on the Pawnee fork, by General Hancock, in April,
1867 (<cite>Report, 23</cite>).</p>

<p>At this stage of affairs Congress appointed a commission to establish
peace with the hostile tribes, by first ascertaining their grievances
and then making such treaties as would remove the causes of dissatisfaction
and afford protection to the frontier settlements, emigrant
roads, and railroads by assigning to the tribes reservations where they
could remain undisturbed in the future. This commission consisted of
N. G. Taylor, president, John B. Sanborn, Samuel F. Tappan, J. B.
Henderson, and Generals William S. Harney, Alfred H. Terry, and
C. C. Augur. Notwithstanding open war was in progress, they found
no difficulty in effecting friendly meetings with the various tribes. In
September and October, 1867, the commission held councils with the
Sioux and Crows and made treaties with the Cheyenne and Arapaho,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
and with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, these being the treaties
under which the latter tribes hold their present or recent reservations
and draw their annuities.</p>

<p>In regard to the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, the commissioners
state that from the testimony they were satisfied that these tribes had
substantially complied with the terms of their treaty made two years
before on the Little Arkansas, the only serious violation being the
killing of James Box and the capture of his family in western Texas
in August, 1866. This is the Set-t'aiñte raid already noted. As excuse
for this, the commissioners state, the Indians urged that they supposed
an attack on Texas people would be no violation of a treaty with the
United States&mdash;that as we ourselves had been at war with the people
of Texas, an act of hostility on their part would not be disagreeable
to us. In regard to numerous other misdeeds credited to these tribes,
they state that the evidence pretty clearly demonstrates that the
charges were almost entirely without foundation (<cite>Report, 24</cite>).</p>

<p>After visiting some of the northern bands, the commissioners went
to Fort Larned, Kansas, whence they sent messengers to the Cheyenne
and Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, notifying them of their
arrival and purpose. They then proceeded to the general tribal rendezvous
on Medicine-lodge creek, about the present site of Medicine
Lodge, Barber county, Kansas, where they met the Indians, and the
treaties were made (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<p>A treaty was first made with the Kiowa and Comanche on October
21, 1867, and by a supplementary treaty made immediately afterward
on the same day, the Apache, at their own request, were formally confederated
and incorporated with them instead of with the Cheyenne
and Arapaho, with whom they had been united by the treaty of the
Little Arkansas two years before. The Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache
together signed the treaty of confederation, which was proclaimed
August 25, 1868. At the same council meeting was made the similar
treaty with the Cheyenne and Arapaho, by which those tribes held
their late reservation and became entitled to their current annuities.
These treaties superseded all previous agreements (<cite>Treaties</cite>).</p>

<p>The Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache treaty provides for peace and
mutual good will, and stipulates that the Indians shall refrain from
further attacks on the whites, and withdraw all opposition to the construction
of railroads and other roads and the building of military
posts in the western country, then or afterward to be authorized by
the government. The usual provision is made for an agency, schools,
farmers, doctor, blacksmith, etc. Article 6 provides for the selection
of farming tracts within the proposed reservation, to be recorded and
held as the individual property of such Indians as may desire to become
farmers.</p>

<p>Article 2 sets apart for the use of the three confederated tribes their
present reservation, bounded on the east by the ninety-eighth meridian,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
on the south and west by Red river and its Northfork, and on the north
by the Washita from the ninety-eighth meridian up to a point 30 miles
by river from Fort Cobb, and thence by a line due west to the North
fork. All within these bounds is solemnly "set apart for the undisturbed
use and occupation of the tribes herein named, and for such other
friendly tribes or individual Indians as from time to time they may
be willing, with the consent of the United States, to admit among them;
and the United States now solemnly agrees that no persons except
those herein authorized so to do, and except such officers, agents, and
employés of the government as may be authorized to enter upon [the]
Indian reservation in discharge of duties enjoined by law, shall ever
be permitted to pass over, settle upon, or reside in the territory described
in this article, or in such territory as may be added to this
reservation, for the use of said Indians."</p>

<p>By article 10 all obligations incurred by the United States under
previous treaties are canceled, and instead the government agrees to
deliver at the agency, "on the 15th day of October of each year, for
thirty years," the equivalent of a full suit of clothing for each Indian
man, woman, and child, for which purpose the agent is to make an
annual census of the tribes; "and in addition to the clothing herein
named, the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars shall be annually appropriated
for a period of thirty years" for the judicious purchase of such
articles as may seem proper to the condition and necessities of the
Indians. Provision is made for the expenditure of a portion of the
clothing fund in other ways for the benefit of the Indians, whenever,
within the period of thirty years, it might seem advisable, "but in no
event shall the amount of this appropriation be withdrawn or discontinued
for the period named." All annuity issues were to be made in
the presence of an army officer detailed for the purpose, who should
inspect and report on the quantity and quality of the goods and the
manner of their delivery.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for establishing a sufficient number of schools
to continue for a period of not less than twenty years. The Indians
agree to surrender all claims to lands outside the reservation as established
in article 2, retaining, however, some temporary hunting privileges
south of the Arkansas. Several minor details are specified, and
by article 12 it is stipulated that no treaty for the sale of any portion
of the reservation thus agreed upon shall have force or validity "unless
executed and signed by at least three-fourths of all the adult male
Indians occupying the same."</p>

</ul>

<p>In addition to the signatures of the commissioners the treaty bears
the names of a number of witnesses, some of them noted in the pioneer
history of the southwest, including Thomas Murphy, superintendent
of Indian affairs, J. H. Leavenworth, agent for the three tribes, and
Philip McCusker, the interpreter, well known in connection with these
tribes until his death in 1885.</p>

<h4 id="RENEWED_HOSTILITIES">RENEWED HOSTILITIES</h4>

<p>As no arrangements had yet been made for the removal of the Indians
to the south, most of them remained encamped on the Arkansas until
June, 1868, when the Cheyenne became involved in difficulty with the
military, resulting in their flight southward to the Canadian and
Washita. On the return of the unsuccessful war party against the
Ute, in which Setdayâ´ite had been killed, as narrated in the calendar
for that year (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>), the Kiowa also left the Arkansas and
removed to the south, thus anticipating measures by General Sherman
to drive all these tribes by military force upon the new reservations
assigned them by the late treaty, notwithstanding the fact that neither
agency buildings nor agents were yet established on either reservation.
In pursuance of this policy, General Sherman, in September, asked to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
have all issues whatever to any of these tribes withheld until they had
concentrated near Fort Cobb on the Washita, and announced that after
waiting a sufficient time for them to reach that point he would solicit
an order declaring all Indians outside these reservations to be outlaws,
"and recommending all people, soldiers, and citizens to proceed against
them as such." He also proposed to declare forfeited the hunting privileges
outside these boundaries, guaranteed under the treaty. Despite
the agent's protest that the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache had done
nothing to deserve such treatment, and the statement of the acting
commissioner that Fort Cobb was not on the Cheyenne and Arapaho
reservation at all, military operations were begun in September, with
this purpose in view, with the result that all five tribes were again
involved in war (<cite>Report, 25</cite>).</p>

<p>However peaceable the Kiowa and Comanche may have been on the
Kansas frontier at this time, they were insolent enough in the south,
for, in addition to raids into Texas, the agent for the Wichita and associated
tribes, which had recently been removed to the vicinity of Fort
Cobb, reports that they had plundered the Wichita of nearly everything,
burned the agency, and forced the employees to leave to save
their lives (<cite>Report, 26</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="BATTLE_OF_THE_WASHITA_REMOVAL_TO_THE_RESERVATION">BATTLE OF THE WASHITA&mdash;REMOVAL TO THE RESERVATION</h4>

<p>The command of operations in Indian Territory was given to General
George A. Custer, who left Fort Dodge, Kansas, with eleven troops of
the Seventh cavalry and twelve troops of Kansas volunteers, and after
establishing Camp Supply, started on a winter campaign, intending to
strike the Indians when they would be least prepared for defense or
flight. The result was the "Battle of the Washita," on November 27,
1868, in which the Cheyenne village under Black-kettle was surprised
and totally destroyed, one hundred and three warriors, including Black-kettle
himself, being killed, a number of prisoners taken, and nearly a
thousand ponies captured and shot, thus practically rendering the
survivors helpless. The engagement occurred on the south bank of
the Washita, in Oklahoma, just above Sergeant-major creek. Most
of the Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache were camped below
along the river for a distance of several miles; the whole forming the
winter camp of the allied tribes. The Kiowa, who were nearest, prepared
to attack, but, being taken at a disadvantage, agreed to go with
the troops to Fort Cobb, the proposed agency. Instead of doing this,
however, the warriors sent their families with their movables in a contrary
direction and attempted to slip away themselves in small parties
until Custer seized Lone-wolf, the head chief, and Set-t'aiñte, next in
authority, and threatened to hang them both unless the absentees
delivered themselves at Fort Cobb within two days. This brought
matters to a head, and the whole tribe, excepting a band which fled
under Woman-heart (<i>Mäñyí-tén</i>) toward the Staked plain, came in and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
surrendered at Fort Cobb within the time specified, about the end
of December, 1868. The two chiefs were thereupon set at liberty. Most
of the Comanche and Apache had already come in immediately after
the Washita fight. The Cheyenne and Arapaho fled to the head of
Red river, where they were followed by Custer, and were brought in
later to their own reservation (<cite>Custer, 1</cite>; <cite>Record, 1</cite>). As an effective
means of holding these tribes in check for the future, Fort Sill was
established in the spring of 1869, nearly in the center of the reservation,
with the agency for the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache adjoining.</p>

<h4 id="FURTHER_INSOLENCE_OF_THE_KIOWA_RAIDS_INTO_TEXAS">FURTHER INSOLENCE OF THE KIOWA&mdash;RAIDS INTO TEXAS</h4>

<p>Although they had been compelled to settle on a reservation, the
Kiowa continued their raids into Texas, destroying property, killing
white people, and carrying away captives. On one occasion they even
attacked the agency at Fort Sill, killed and wounded several men,
stampeded the agency cattle and the quartermaster's mules, and defiantly
challenged the soldiers to come out and fight. Civil and military
officials alike agree that there was not the slightest excuse for these outrages,
to which they were encouraged by the Kwáhadi Comanche, who
had never yet come in from the Staked plain and who never ceased to
ridicule those Indians who had submitted. To put an end to this state
of affairs, the Commissioner in 1870 recommended the establishment of
a line of posts along the southern boundary of the reservation, and
that the Kiowa and Comanche should all be placed under military control
until they had learned to behave properly (<cite>Report, 27</cite>).</p>

<p>Affairs went on from bad to worse. In 1871 a large raiding party
killed seven men in Texas, torturing one over a fire, and capturing a
number of mules. The leaders had the hardihood to boast of their
deed in the presence of the agent and General Sherman, who promptly
arrested the three most prominent, Set-t'aiñte, Setängya, and Ä´do-eétte
or "Big-tree." Setängya (Satank) resisted and was killed. The other
two were sent to Texas for trial and punishment (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<p>In 1872 another Commissioner declared that the point had been
reached where forbearance had ceased to be a virtue, and again recommended
that the three tribes be turned over to the military for punishment.
He states that a wholesome example is absolutely necessary
to command obedience, asserting that "so long as four-fifths of these
tribes take turns at raiding into Texas, openly and boastfully bringing
back scalps and spoils to their reservation, efforts to inspire very high
ideas of social and industrial life among the communities of which the
raiders form so large a part will presumably result in failure." At the
same time their agent reports that, although they had come regularly
for their rations during the preceding winter and spring, giving
repeated assurance of amity and peace, yet so soon as their horses
were in condition in summer the Kiowa had gone on the warpath, taking
with them a large number of the Comanche and Apache, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
within a few months had stolen hundreds of horses and mules, carried
off several captive women and children, and killed over twenty persons
in Texas, besides others in New Mexico and elsewhere. By withholding
rations for three months, he had compelled them to bring in two
captives without ransom, and states that he would continue to withhold
supplies from them until the other was surrendered. He declared,
finally, that the Kiowa and some bands of the Comanche were beyond
control by him (<cite>Report, 28</cite>). The calendar for this year (q. v.) also
takes note of these raids.</p>

<h4 id="INTERTRIBAL_PEACE_COUNCIL_1872">INTERTRIBAL PEACE COUNCIL, 1872</h4>

<p>In the summer of 1872 the general council of the civilized tribes of
Indian Territory sent a commission to the wild tribes in the western
part of the territory to urge them to a permanent peace among themselves
and with the United States. This Indian commission met the
chiefs and headmen of the Caddo, Wichita, and affiliated tribes, the
Cheyenne and Arapaho, and the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache,
together with their agents, near Fort Cobb, in July and August, and
had several talks with them, resulting in a general friendly feeling
among the tribes, but without any very substantial outcome in regard
to the Kiowa, who demanded the release of Set-t'aiñte and Big-tree as
a preliminary to negotiations. They did surrender two white captives,
as already stated, but this appears to have been due to the stoppage of
rations by the agent rather than to the efforts of the peacemakers.
Notwithstanding the rose-colored report of the commission, we learn
from the agent that while Kicking-bird, as always, was on the side of
peace, White-horse (<i>Tseñ-t'aiñte</i>), the notorious raider, declared that
the old chiefs might make peace, but he and the young men would raid
when they chose, while Lone-wolf, the head chief, declared that they
would not make peace or return their captives until Set-t'aiñte and
Big-tree were released and the Kiowa reservation extended from the
Rio Grande to the Missouri. He modified his terms, however, when he
found that all rations and annuities were to be cut off until the captives
were unconditionally released (<cite>Report, 29</cite>). About the same time the
Kiowa invited the Cheyenne to join them in forming a combination of
the southwestern tribes to make war on the whites and effect the
release of the imprisoned chiefs, but the Cheyenne refused the proposition
(<cite>Report, 30</cite>).</p>

<p>Soon after, in the same year, another commission was sent out from
Washington to the same tribes to discuss with them the subject of their
own and the government's treaty obligations, and to warn them in
plain terms that unless they ceased their raids outside their reservations
the military would be directed to begin active operations against them,
and that all parties hereafter leaving the reservation to go into Texas
would be considered as hostiles to be attacked without inquiry and to
be followed into their camps, if necessary, for punishment.</p>

<h4 id="JOINT_DELEGATION_TO_WASHINGTON_1872">JOINT DELEGATION TO WASHINGTON, 1872</h4>

<p>An important object of the commission was to obtain a good representative
delegation of the several tribes to visit Washington, with the
view of impressing them on the way with the strength of the whites,
in order to obtain a better understanding on their arrival. Although
the other tribes generally responded promptly and satisfactorily, the
Kiowa, as usual, were disposed to be perverse. At last, however, a
party, including Lone-wolf, Woman-heart, Red-otter (<i>Ápeñ-gúadal</i>),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
Dohásän (son of the former great chief), Sun-boy (<i>Paí-tälyí</i>), Stumbling-bear,
and others, met the commission on the Washita and consented
to send delegates to Washington on the promise that their
imprisoned chiefs, Set-t'aiñte and Big-tree, should be allowed to meet
them at some point on the way, or that if five delegates were sent, the
prisoners should be allowed to accompany them. A delegation had
been selected to start for the east in September, when a rumor came of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
a movement of troops in the vicinity of their remoter camps, with the
result that a number of the assembled Indians stampeded, including
several of the promised delegates. The Kiowa delegation, as it finally
left, consisted of four men&mdash;Lone-wolf, the head chief, Sun-boy, <i>Gui-k`ate</i>
("Wolf-lying down," improperly rendered "Sleeping-wolf") and one
other. The Apache delegates were Pacer, Daho, and Gray-eagle.</p>

<p>In accordance with the promise, the two imprisoned chiefs were sent
on under guard to St Louis, where they were allowed to see and talk
with their friends, after which they were returned to the custody of the
governor of Texas. The whole delegation, which was the largest and
most important that had ever visited Washington, included representatives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
of all the southern plains tribes, excepting the Cheyenne and the
Kwáhadi Comanche of the Staked plain. The latter had never entered
into a treaty and refused to be settled on a reservation, although protesting
their desire to be at peace. Whatever hopes may have been
built on these negotiations, the events of the next two years would
seem to prove to have been futile.</p>

<h4 id="THOMAS_C_BATTEY_FIRST_TEACHER_AMONG_THE_KIOWA_1872">THOMAS C. BATTEY, FIRST TEACHER AMONG THE KIOWA, 1872</h4>

<p>In December, 1872, Thomas C. Battey, a Quaker, the first teacher
who made any impression on the Kiowa, came among them after a short
sojourn with the Caddo, and remained about eight months. Although
he accomplished little in the way of education, owing to the restless
nomadic habits of the tribe, his influence with Kicking-bird (<i>T'ené-angópte</i>)
probably kept that chief and his band from the warpath in
the outbreak of 1874. He has left a most interesting and valuable
narrative of his experiences among the Kiowa, who still hold him in
friendly remembrance as <i>Támĭsi</i> (see <a href="#Battey"><cite>Battey</cite></a>).</p>

<h4 id="REPORT_OF_CAPTAIN_ALVORD">REPORT OF CAPTAIN ALVORD</h4>

<p>The report of Captain Alvord, chairman of the commission, in regard
to the Kiowa, is a good summary of the situation as concerns them up
to date. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Kiowas, from their present attitude and their conduct during the last two or
three years, demand especial consideration. The tribe numbers about 1,200. In 1868
they barely avoided a serious conflict with the United States troops, and, although
the larger part of them were brought to within a reasonable distance of their
agency, and suitably located in the spring of 1869, they soon returned to their favorite
range between the Wichita mountains and the eastern slope of the Staked Plains,
whence unrestrained they have most of the time since made frequent and successful
expeditions in different directions, chiefly into Texas. To a certain extent they are
subdivided into bands, and the chiefs of these have evinced different degrees of
friendship, but it would be impossible to deal with them otherwise than as a tribe.</p>

<p>As already stated, their hostilities of the past year were pursuant to their deliberate
decision, and it is safe to state that at least one-half of the terrible scenes of
blood, fire, and pillage which they have caused have never yet been reported to the
Department. The cold-blooded murders of inoffensive persons known to have been
committed by them within two years approach a hundred, and they have now in
their herds not less than a thousand stolen horses and mules, including over two
hundred taken within a few months from the troops and agencies in their vicinity.</p>

<p>Lately they have yielded to a demand made upon them and given up the only white
captives known to be among them, and there is no doubt that the present delegation,
with the man at its head acknowledged as the principal chief of the tribe, will make
every profession of friendship in the future and be anxious to cry quits and begin
anew on peace terms. Nevertheless, while I desire to give this people all the credit
they deserve, the opinion is very positively expressed that these apparently friendly
acts on their part are no guarantees for the future, but simply repetitions of their
conduct every autumn, when it is highly important to them to place themselves in
position to receive during the winter months the material aid in subsistence and
clothing afforded by the government. Gladly will they offer this fall certain terms
of peace, but these will be found wholly in their favor&mdash;entire forgiveness for all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
past offenses, the possession of the greater portion of their stolen property, and full
restoration to the rights and privileges of the plains Indians in general. But the
promises of future good conduct will be utterly worthless, and, these terms granted,
there will be every prospect of a renewal of their depredations as soon as the early
grass recuperates their stock and they find themselves able to subsist on the prairies.</p>

<p>The present position of the Kiowas may not be exactly one of open hostility, but
it is certainly nothing less than the most offensive insubordination. Their agent
for the past three years, a sincere member of the Society of Friends, a man who has
proved himself eminently fitted for the place, declares this tribe uncontrollable,
and states his belief that nothing less than military authority, with perhaps some
punishment by troops, will bring them into such subjection as to again render the
services of a civil agent of benefit to them.</p>

<p>The Kiowas have no shadow of excuse for their conduct. For three years they
have received their annuity goods, of proper quantity and quality; have drawn
their rations regularly until their action last spring compelled their agent to refuse
them; and in no way have they received any injury from the government troops or
agents. The arrest of two of their chiefs under due process of law, with their
subsequent trial and conviction in the state of Texas, must not be forgotten; but
the government at once interceded and secured a commutation of their sentence,
and the Kiowas were informed that the fate of their chiefs depended on the future
action of the tribe. This can in no way be considered an excuse for them, uncivilized
as they are, and as a pretext it but makes their conduct worse.</p>

<p>It is not only recommended, but strongly urged, that the United States government
no longer receive their proffer, but dictate to this tribe its own terms of
settlement, making sure guarantees of safety to the lives and property of its citizens
in the future.</p>

<p>I recommend that the representatives of the Kiowas now in Washington be told,
in the presence of the entire delegation, that the government proposes to dictate
its own terms to that tribe, and that they be the following: The entire tribe to
encamp before November 30 at some suitable point near Fort Sill (for instance,
Crawford's creek), where every movement can be watched by troops. All horses or
mules found in their herds, undoubtedly taken from the government and from
private parties during the past two years, to be given up within the same time, and
the tribe to make good from their other stock any such animals found with other
tribes, by them obtained from the Kiowas&mdash;and the tribe to surrender to the proper
authorities, for trial by United States courts, the three most prominent men of those
engaged in the greatest atrocities during the past year. Also, that they be told
that the recent conduct of the tribe prevents all present hope of the release of their
two prisoner chiefs, and that the liberty of those and the others to be given up will
depend entirely upon future good behavior. Also, that no annuity goods whatever
be issued to them for the present year, and that hunting parties be allowed to leave
camp only when accompanied by a proper detachment of troops.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the necessary arrangements be made at once to have a
sufficient body of troops in readiness to enforce compliance with these terms. If
such a force is known by the Indians to be prepared to move by the 20th of November,
it is believed that the terms will be complied with on time. Otherwise the
movement should take place promptly on the 1st day of December, and under a
judicious officer the tribe can be reached and compelled to yield with very little
probability of an actual conflict. As elsewhere suggested, it would be desirable to
have a proper representative of the Indian office accompany the troops.</p>

<p>Should these recommendations be approved, it would be well also to notify them
that, having come or been forced into camp as proposed, they will be closely watched,
and any movement, great or small, not fully authorized by whoever has them in
charge, will subject the movers to immediate attack.</p>

<p>It is deemed especially important that the decision of the department as to the
course it will pursue toward the Kiowas be fully explained to them, and to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Apaches and Comanches, before the present delegation returns to the territory, and
that all the other tribes be warned that, in case of any resistance on the part of the
Kiowas, any Indians found aiding or communicating with them will be summarily
dealt with (<cite>Report, 31</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The principal event of 1873 was the release and return to their people
of the chiefs Set-t'aiñte and Big-tree, who had been imprisoned in
Texas under jurisdiction of the state authorities (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
On the assurance given to the delegates in Washington that their chiefs
would be restored to them in the spring, provided the tribe remained
peaceably on the reservation in the meantime, the Kiowa had conducted
themselves properly through the winter. With spring, however, came
the Modok war, with the killing of General Canby, which created such
a distrust of Indians in general that the people of Texas were unwilling
to surrender the prisoners, whom they regarded as hostages for the
safety of the frontier. Notwithstanding their disappointment, the
Kiowa remained quietly at home, patiently waiting until the government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
should bring influence to bear on the governor of Texas to redeem
its promise. The prisoners, accompanied by Governor Davis of Texas
and the Indian Commissioner, were at last brought to Fort Sill, where
a council was held with the Kiowa in October. At the opening of the
council the governor of Texas made a number of hard demands as preliminary
to the surrender of the chiefs, although the government had
already promised their unconditional release in consideration of the
good conduct of the tribe during the last year. Some of these conditions
were practically impossible, and for a time it seemed as if the
whole purpose of the negotiations would be defeated, Kicking-bird,
the leader of the friendly element, declaring that the government had
lied and that the white man was no longer his friend, while Lone-wolf
threatened war even though it should mean the destruction of their
people. It became evident that there would be a desperate encounter
if the chiefs were not now set free as promised, and on the earnest
representations of the Indian Commissioner the governor finally yielded
in his demands, and Set-t'aiñte and Big-tree were released from custody
on October 8, 1873, subject, however, to rearrest by the state of Texas
whenever it should appear that any of the Kiowa had again been raiding
there. Although this condition was in violation of the promises
made by the government, the Indians were compelled to be satisfied.
An unsuccessful attempt was made by the governor to force the
Comanche, by the delivery of hostages, to similar conditions. To show
their good will, however, a party of Comanche volunteered to assist a
detachment of troops in bringing in any of their young men who might
then be raiding in Texas. During their absence on this errand a party
of Texans visited the reservation and ran off two hundred horses and
mules <cite>(Report, 32</cite>; <cite>Battey, 1</cite>).</p>

<p>The Quaker teacher, Battey, who was present during the council,
thus describes the release of the chiefs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Satanta and Big Tree, after embracing the governor, proceeded to embrace the
chiefs present, and immediately returned with them to the agent's office, from whence
they went to their rude home in their camps. The reunion of these chiefs with
their tribe and families was impressive and affecting in the extreme. Joy beamed
upon every countenance, and their happiness was exhibited, as might be expected,
in the most wild and natural manner.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reports continued to fill the newspapers of renewed raids into Texas
by Set-t'aiñte and Big-tree, when Battey asserts&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To my certain knowledge the latter was at home, sick in his lodge, and the former
enjoying, after two years' confinement in prison, the pleasures of the buffalo chase,
on territory assigned for the purpose (<cite>Battey, 2</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="HAWORTHS_ADMINISTRATION_1873mdash78">HAWORTH'S ADMINISTRATION&mdash;1873&mdash;78</h4>

<p>At this time the various agencies were in charge of agents nominated
by different religious bodies in accordance with the "peace policy"
inaugurated by President Grant. The agent for the Kiowa, Comanche,
and Apache was J. M. Haworth, nominated by the Society of Friends,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
of which body his acts show him to have been a consistent member,
who held charge for five years, from April, 1873, to April, 1878, including
the troublous period of the outbreak and subsequent readjustment.
In spite of the many difficulties at the time, he soon gained
the confidence of these wild and warlike people, and conceived and
successfully inaugurated the first substantial work of civilization
among them in the way of schools, farming and stock raising, and
the building up of friendly relations with the whites. He is held in
grateful memory among the Kiowa, who know him as <i>Sénpo gúadal</i>,
"Red-beard." An extract from his first report shows the spirit in
which he met them and their quick response:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I took charge, I told the Indians in council that I had come among them as
their friend and desired us to live together as friends. As a proof of my confidence
in them, I had the soldiers whom I found on duty removed, and relied upon them to
conduct themselves in a peaceable and friendly manner; told them with their help
we could make this a peaceable country to live in. I desired them to refrain from
raiding or stealing. The chiefs promised me assistance; said if their young men
would not listen, but ran off and stole horses, they would bring in to me all they
brought back, and I could restore them to their owners. A short time ago I reminded
the Comanches of their promise&mdash;told them I had heard some of their young men
had been in Texas and brought back a number of horses. Within two weeks from
the time I spoke to them fifty-two head of horses and mules were delivered to me as
having been stolen from Texas since I came in charge as agent. I did not make any
threats of stopping rations, or anything of the kind; simply reminded them of
their promises and appealed to their better natures, with the very satisfactory result
referred to (<cite>Report, 33</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="FIRST_SCHOOL_ESTABLISHED_BY_BATTEY">FIRST SCHOOL ESTABLISHED BY BATTEY</h4>

<p>Early in 1873 also, another Quaker, Thomas C. Battey, attempted the
first school work among the Kiowa, as already noted. Although a conscientious
worker, the force of their wandering habits and Indian beliefs
was still too strong, and the effort in its direct purpose was a failure.
He remained with them some months, however, and the good impression
he made had much to do with keeping the larger portion of the tribe
from the warpath in the subsequent outbreak. He thus sums up his
school experiment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Having erected a tent and fitted it up, I commenced a school with twenty-two
children in attendance, which continued for something over a week, during which
time the children manifested their aptitude to learn by the progress they made. The
elder people also manifested much interest in it by their frequent visits, their attention
to the exercises, and their encouraging words to the children. About this time,
much sickness prevailing among the children in the camp, some superstitious Caddoes
who happened there attributed the sickness among them to me, telling them I
was a bad medicine man and had made some of their children sick when I was with
them, two of whom died. This had the effect to entirely break up the school, though
I continued my efforts to renew it for nearly two months. Sometimes when I would
get a few children collected, they would be driven out by their old men. Sometimes
young men would come in, laugh at them, and abuse them until they would leave.
After about two months they became more unsettled, moving from place to place
almost continually, searching for better grass for their stock, better water, more
wood, to get buffalo, etc. As we were seldom but a day or two in a place, I gave up
all effort to sustain a school (<cite>Battey, 3</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="THE_OUTBREAK_OF_1874_75">THE OUTBREAK OF 1874&mdash;75</h4>

<h5 id="CAUSES_OF_THE_DISSENSION">CAUSES OF THE DISSENSION</h5>

<p>But events were steadily drifting toward war again and the truce
was of brief duration, the unrest culminating in the general revolt commonly
known as the outbreak of 1874. As this was the last, and will
forever remain the last, combination of the southern plains tribes
against the power of the white man, resulting in their complete and
final subjection, it merits somewhat detailed attention.</p>

<p>In late raids into Texas several of the Comanche had been killed by
the hated Tonkawa, a small cannibal tribe, in their capacity of government
scouts (see the <a href="#d1873_74">calendar, 1873&mdash;74</a>). The wailing laments of
the Comanche women for their dead, and their appeals for vengeance,
urged the warriors to go down once more into Texas and exterminate
the remnants of the man-eaters who had escaped the massacre of twelve
years before. To add to their discontent, a lawless band of hunters
organized in Dodge City, Kansas, had, in the spring of 1873, established
an adobe fort, known as the "Adobe Walls," on the South Canadian,
in the panhandle of Texas, from which headquarters they were
making inroads on the guaranteed hunting grounds of the Indians and
were slaughtering the buffalo by thousands, in defiance of the government
promises that such intrusion would be prevented. It was also
charged that they directly incited disorder by selling whisky, arms,
and ammunition to the Indians in return for stolen stock. In his official
report on the outbreak, General Pope states emphatically that the
unlawful intrusion and criminal conduct of the white hunters were
the principal cause of the war (<cite>War, 1</cite>). This is confirmed by the testimony
of white men employed at the Cheyenne agency at the time,
who stated to the author that just before going out the Cheyenne
chiefs rode down and assured them that they need have no fear, as the
Indians considered them as friends and would not molest them, but
were compelled to fight the buffalo hunters, who were destroying their
means of subsistence. "Then they shook hands with us and rode off
and began killing people."</p>

<p>Shortly before this the son and nephew of Lone-wolf, the principal
chief of the Kiowa, had been killed in Mexico. He went down with a
party in the summer of 1874 and buried their bodies, making a solemn
vow at the same time to kill a white man in retaliation, and thus communicating
to his people the bitterness which he felt himself (see the
<a href="#d1873_74">calendar, 1873&mdash;74</a>). Lone-wolf is described by Battey about this time
as being several years older than Kicking-bird, not so far seeing, more
hasty and rash in his conclusions, as well as more treacherous and cunning,
but with less depth of mind. He was the acknowledged leader
of the war element in the tribe.</p>

<p>While lawless white men were thus destroying the buffalo, the Indians
themselves were suffering for food. The agent for the Cheyenne
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
reports that for nearly four months preceding the outbreak the rations
had fallen short, and expresses the opinion that if there had been a
full supply he could have held the tribe from the warpath. At the
same time they were being systematically robbed of their stock by
organized bands of horse thieves. The immediate cause of the outbreak
by the Cheyenne in May, 1874, was the stealing by these men of
forty-three valuable ponies belonging to the chief, Little-robe. In
attempting to recover them Little-robe's son was dangerously wounded,
in revenge for which the Cheyenne soon after killed a member of a surveying
party in the Kiowa country and at once began open hostilities
(<cite>Report, 34</cite>; <cite>Battey, 4</cite>).

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 51&mdash;Gui-pägo or Lone-wolf, present head-chief of the Kiowa.</p>
</div>

<p>Agent Miles thus tersely sums up the provocation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The lack of power to administer the law&mdash;to remove improper characters from
this reservation, to break up the various bands of dissolute white men, horse and
cattle thieves, known to be operating in our vicinity&mdash;is the prime cause that may be
assigned for the serious outbreak among the Cheyennes on this reservation. As
elsewhere stated, the Cheyennes and Arapahoes were assured by the President, on
their recent visit to Washington, that improper white men and buffalo hunters
should be kept from their country at all hazards, and they very naturally expected
that some effort would be made to keep that promise; but they have looked in vain,
and the Cheyennes, being the most restless of the two tribes, grew tired and endeavored
to avenge their own wrongs. The result of such a proceeding could have but
one ending, and that was to bring them into conflict with the general government
(<cite>Report, 35</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h5 id="THE_COMANCHE_MEDICINE-MAN">THE COMANCHE MEDICINE-MAN</h5>

<p>At this critical juncture a young medicine-man named Ĭ´sätaí arose
among the Kwáhadi Comanche&mdash;the wildest and most intractable portion
of the tribe&mdash;with claims of supernatural powers. He asserted
his ability to cure all diseases and to restore the dead to life, and said
that he had been taken up repeatedly into the home of the Father of
the Indians, above the sun and far above the abode of the white man's
God, and that there he had been given control of the elements, with
power to send rain, wind, thunder, lightning, or drought upon the earth
as he pleased. What was most to the purpose, he promised to protect
all who should believe in him, as he could produce cartridges in unlimited
quantities from his stomach for his friends, and could so influence
the guns of the whites, and particularly of the soldiers, that they
would not shoot Indians, even though the latter stood in front of the
muzzles. It was the old story of the Indian medicine-man that has
been familiar from the time of the Shawano prophet to the messiah of
the ghost dance.</p>

<p>His words created great excitement among the Comanche, nearly all
of whom believed him. Some of his deluded followers asserted that
they had themselves seen him ascend into the sky and again descend
to earth, and at another time had seen him produce from his stomach
nearly a wagon load of cartridges. Finally he commanded the tribe
to assemble in May, 1874, at the junction of Elk creek (<i>Donä´i P'a</i>,
"Pecan river") with the North fork of Red river, to see the proofs of
his mission and to hear his message to the people. So great an impression
had his fame produced by this time that even the friendly chiefs
attended, as well as the main body of the Cheyenne and a part of the
Kiowa. This was a new departure for the Comanche, who, according
to all authorities, had never before "made medicine" as a tribe (<i>Report,
36</i>; <cite>Battey, 5</cite>).</p>

<p>On assembling at the designated spot the Indians were harangued
by the medicine-man, who told them that their god commanded them
to avenge their murdered kindred. Accordingly a party was made up
to go to Texas and kill the Tonkawa, who, as has been stated, were cannibals,
for which reason, and for the additional one that they constantly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
served as scouts against the other Indians, they were regarded with
common hatred by all the tribes. Learning of the proposed expedition,
Agent Haworth warned the commander of Fort Griffin, near which
post the Tonkawa were located, who had them removed to the post
for safety. This being reported to the confederate tribes by their spies,
they changed their program and decided to go out on the plains and
kill the buffalo hunters at Adobe Walls.</p>

<p>Finding that the whole purpose of the gathering was warlike, those
who desired to avoid trouble determined to return to the agency, but
found that such a move had been anticipated by the hostiles, who
declared that they would prevent any return, even if they had to kill
the ponies of the friendlies to do it. Notwithstanding, a number of
the Comanche, chiefly of the Penätĕka band, made the attempt and
succeeded in getting away to the agency. The main body of the tribe,
the warlike Kwáhadi, and all the Cheyenne, decided for war (<i>Report,
37</i>). A few of the Kiowa were also among them, but as yet only one
chief, Woman-heart, had smoked the war-pipe with the Comanche and
Cheyenne, the rest of the tribe being still near the agency (<cite>Battey, 6</cite>).
During all the subsequent troubles the Apache remained quiet and
peaceable in the friendly camp at Fort Sill.</p>

<h5 id="APACHE_AND_ARAPAHO_FRIENDLINESS">APACHE AND ARAPAHO FRIENDLINESS</h5>

<p>During the whole period of the outbreak the Arapaho also remained
loyal and friendly, in accordance with their treaty pledges and their
general character, although the Cheyenne, with whom they were confederated,
were the most determined of the hostiles. As soon as it became
manifest that trouble was at hand, the Arapaho came in to the agency
of the two tribes at Darlington to warn the agent and his employés,
and, as a proof of their friendship, furnished an Indian police force,
who stood guard over the agency every night until all danger was
past. The sole exception to their uniform friendly conduct was the
assassination of an employé named Frank Hollowell (or Holloway), in
July, 1874, by two young Arapaho, the principal of whom was afterward
convicted of the crime and died in prison. This was the only
hostile act committed at the Cheyenne and Arapaho agency during the
outbreak (<cite>Report, 38</cite>).</p>

<h5 id="FURTHER_DEFIANCE">FURTHER DEFIANCE</h5>

<p>The hostile Comanche and Kiowa now began to steal stock from
around the agency at Fort Sill, and in response to a message sent to
their camp by the agent, defiantly replied that they would not return
the stock now, but would keep it to make peace with when they came
back in the fall. They added that they would not molest the agency
further if not interfered with by the soldiers, but if the soldiers came
upon them they intended to come in and kill anyone they met (<i>Battey,
7</i>).</p>

<p>One or two trifling encounters occurred in May between the troops
and Indians, presumably Comanche and Kiowa, in western Texas, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
others more serious in June farther north, in Indian Territory and the
adjoining part of Kansas, the Indians concerned being probably chiefly
Cheyenne.</p>

<h5 id="BATTLE_OF_ADOBE_WALLS">BATTLE OF ADOBE WALLS</h5>

<p>In the latter part of June, 1874, the confederated Comanche, Cheyenne,
and Kiowa made a combined attack upon the buffalo hunters
intrenched in the fort of the Adobe Walls, on South Canadian river, in
the Texas panhandle. The engagement began about the 27th, and
continued several days, the Indians attacking with desperate courage,
urged on by their medicine-man, who had assured them that the bullets
of the whites could not hurt them. The hunters, however, had a small
field cannon, and with this, protected as they were by the solid walls
of adobe, they finally compelled the Indians to withdraw with considerable
loss. The medicine-man excused the result on the ground that
his medicine was for guns and not for cannon. The combined force was
led by Quanah, the present noted head chief of the Comanche, who
informed the author that he had seven hundred warriors in the fight,
but added sententiously, "No use Indians fight adobe." The result
convinced him of the falsity of the claims of medicine-men, against
whom he has ever since used his powerful influence in his tribe. Finding
their position untenable without military protection, which was
refused by the general commanding the department, the buffalo hunters
soon afterward abandoned the fort. The location is known among
the Kiowa as "The place where Quanah led his confederates" (see
<cite>Report, 39</cite>; <cite>War, 2</cite>; Record, 2).</p>

<p>On July 3 a small wagon train in charge of Patrick Hennessey and
three other men, loaded with supplies from Wichita, Kansas, for the
Wichita agency at Anadarko, was attacked by Cheyenne on the trail
where now stands the town of Hennessey, Oklahoma. The four white
men were killed and scalped, the stores and mules taken, and the
wagons burned. Hennessey was tortured by being tied to a wagon
wheel and burned upon a pile of grain taken from his own wagon.
This last deed was the work of some Osage who came up while the
Cheyenne were still there, and who secured the larger share of the
plunder. These same Osage were ostensibly friends of the whites, and
had completely deceived their agent and missionary into the belief that
they were doing all in their power to quiet the hostile tribes. The
bodies of three of the men killed were buried by a neighboring ranchman,
who had warned them of their danger only a few hours before,
and unsuccessfully endeavored to persuade them to turn back. Hennessey's
remains were buried two days later by a party under agent
Miles (<cite>Battey, 8</cite>; <cite>Report, 40</cite>).</p>

<h5 id="FRIENDLIES_COLLECTED_AT_FORT_SILL">FRIENDLIES COLLECTED AT FORT SILL</h5>

<p>By this time the Cheyenne agency at Darlington was closely surrounded
by bands of hostiles. Arming a small force of employés, the
agent proceeded north to Wichita, Kansas, for assistance, after sending
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
a courier through by night to Colonel Davidson at Fort Sill for
temporary aid. That officer promptly sent a troop of cavalry, which,
however, was intercepted at the Wichita agency (Anadarko), then
threatened by the Kiowa and Comanche. In response to the appeals of
Agent Miles, a sufficient force of cavalry and infantry was sent from
Fort Leavenworth to protect the Darlington agency. As soon as it
had appeared that war was inevitable, Whirlwind, head chief of the
tribe, with his band of Cheyenne, had moved into the agency, where
he remained steadfastly peaceable. White-shield also ranged himself
on the side of peace, and consented to carry a message to the hostile
camp, as a result of which Little-robe and a number of others broke
away at night and came into the agency, being compelled to abandon
their tipis and most of their household goods to effect their escape
(<cite>Report, 41</cite>).</p>

<p>The Kiowa medicine dance, which was held usually in June, had
been postponed on account of the absence of Lone-wolf, who had gone
to Texas after the bodies of his son and nephew. On his return it was
held at a point on the North fork of Red river (see the <a href="#d1874">calendar, 1874</a>),
being attended in force by the Comanche and Cheyenne, who made a
strong effort to engage the Kiowa in the war. The dance closed on
the 3d of July, when a small minority, led by Lone-wolf and Swan,
decided for war and joined the hostiles, but the majority, under Kicking-bird,
declared for peace and came in to the agency at Fort Sill.
Here the friendly Indians of the different tribes belonging to the
agency&mdash;Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache&mdash;were directed to encamp
together on Cache creek, where they were enrolled by order of Colonel
Davidson, after which none were to be allowed to come in and join the
camp of the friendlies without surrendering their arms and obtaining
a guarantee from the agent that they were guiltless of hostile acts.
Similar orders were carried out in regard to the Indians of the Wichita
agency at Anadarko. The enrollment showed four-fifths of the Kiowa
among the friendlies, although, as the agent remarks, doubtless some of
them did not deserve the name. With some inconsistency, Lone-wolf
sent a message declaring his desire for peace and asking permission to
come in to the friendly camp; but, as he was considered the leader and
one of the most guilty of the hostiles, his request was refused. In the
meantime orders had been issued from the War Department, on July
21, authorizing the military to punish the hostiles wherever found, even
to pursuing them upon their reservations. General Pope, commanding
the department, at once set the troops in motion, and a vigorous campaign
began from the north and south of the exposed territory.</p>

<h5 id="FIGHT_AT_ANADARKO_THE_WICHITA_AGENCY">FIGHT AT ANADARKO, THE WICHITA AGENCY</h5>

<p>Late in August a band of Nokoni Comanche came into the camp of
friendly Comanche at the Wichita agency (Anadarko), desiring to
remain. Colonel Davidson, commanding at Fort Sill, went over with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
detachment of troops to receive their surrender. They agreed to give
up their arms, and had already delivered a number of guns and pistols,
when a question arose as to the bows and arrows, and a messenger was
sent to the commanding officer to decide the matter. While the messenger
was gone, the chief, Red-food, gave a whoop&mdash;whether as a
battle signal or merely to call another chief, is a disputed point&mdash;and
was immediately fired upon by the guard. Lone-wolf and his Kiowa
were on the ground and at once opened fire on the troops. A general
fight ensued (August 22), the excitement being intense, as it happened
to be ration day and nearly all the Indians of the Wichita
agency were present&mdash;Caddo, Wichita, Delaware, and Pawnee&mdash;as well
as a large number of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache of the other
agency. Runners hurried to all the camps with the news that the
troops were killing the Indians; but, notwithstanding, the fighting was
confined to the Kiowa and Comanche, who attacked the agency, burning
the schoolhouse, sacking Shirley's trading store, burning several
houses of the friendly Indians, killing at least four citizens, and wounding
several soldiers. While some fled to places of safety, others kept
up the attack until next day, when, failing in a final attempt to take
and burn the agency, they withdrew. According to the statement
of the Indians, they lost two men and one woman killed and a few
wounded. A part of the Kiowa engaged had been enrolled at Fort
Sill among the friendlies, but had gone without permission to the
Wichita agency some days before. Some of the Comanche who fled
at the time of the fight came in soon after and reported to Colonel
Davidson, and, on being assured that no harm was intended them,
returned with him to the friendly camp at Fort Sill. In regard to this
encounter, the Comanche disclaimed any hostile intention at the start,
and the fact that they had voluntarily come in and surrendered their
guns would show that it was the result of a panic arising from a misunderstanding
(see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>; also <cite>Report, 42</cite>; <cite>Battey, 9</cite>; <cite>Record, 3</cite>).</p>

<p>As showing the moral effect of a knowledge of the power of the
white man, it is worthy of record that only one of the Kiowa delegates
to Washington in 1872 joined the hostiles, that one, Lone-wolf,
being avowedly incited to his course by a thirst for vengeance for
his son (<cite>Report, 43</cite>). As a commentary on the treatment frequently
accorded "friendlies" during an outbreak, it may also be noted that
the enrolled Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache were located two miles from
Fort Sill, where Texas horse thieves stole over nineteen hundred of
their animals within a year, while they themselves were kept almost
at starvation point by the contractor's failure to supply their rations.
Notwithstanding these discouragements they continued loyal, and
sent as many of their children to school as could be accommodated
(<cite>Battey, 10</cite>).</p>

<p>After the fight at the Wichita agency most of the Kiowa and
Comanche concerned fled to the Staked plain, where the hostiles made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
their chief headquarters. Some others not already enrolled now came
in and asked permission to join the friendly camp. Set-t'aiñte, Big-tree,
Woman-heart, and Poor-buffalo (Pá-tádal, "Lean-buffalo-bull"),
who had been enrolled at the beginning, but had gone without permission
to the Washita and fled from there at the time of the fight,
came in soon after to the Cheyenne agency at Darlington and surrendered
with a large number of their people, saying that they were tired
of war, but did not like Fort Sill. As it was believed that they had
taken part in hostilities, they were not allowed again to resume their
position as friendlies, but were sent back as prisoners of war to Fort
Sill, where their arms and horses were taken from them and the
men were imprisoned, the chiefs being put in irons. Soon afterward
Set-t'aiñte was returned to the Texas penitentiary (<cite>Report, 44</cite>).</p>

<h5 id="SET-TAINTE">SET-T'AIÑTE</h5>

<p>Set-t'aiñte, "White-bear," better known as Satanta, who was thus
finally removed from the field of action, is one of the most prominent
men in Kiowa history, being noted among the most daring and successful
warriors of the tribe, while in authority he held the rank of
second chief, standing next after Lone-wolf. He has already been
mentioned as a leading chief in 1864. His eloquence and vigor of expression
in his native language, a peculiarly forcible one, had gained for
him the title of the "Orator of the Plains." Every line of his strongly
marked features showed the character of the man&mdash;a brave, forceful,
untamable savage (<a href="#fig45">figure 45</a>). The persistent efforts of the Kiowa to
secure his release prove the estimation in which he was held by his
tribe. He came early into prominence and was one of the signers of the
treaty of 1867, his name being second on the list. His seizure by General
Custer the next year, in order to compel the Kiowa to come into
the reservation, and his subsequent release, have been narrated. His
arrest in 1871 for being concerned in an attack upon a wagon train in
Texas, the commutation of the death sentence, and his release by the
state authorities in 1873, have also been noted in the proper place. He
was still, however, considered as a hostage for the good conduct of his
people, and subject to rearrest whenever they became troublesome. As
was almost inevitable, he became involved in the outbreak of the succeeding
year, although apparently more by accident than deliberate
purpose, and on coming in to Cheyenne agency with others in the
fall of 1874 he was again arrested and turned over to the military
authorities and by them sent back to the state penitentiary at Huntsville,
Texas, to serve out his life sentence (<cite>Report, 45</cite>). When informed
by Horace P. Jones, the government interpreter at Fort Sill, that he
was to be returned to prison, he expressed himself bitterly, claiming
that he had kept his parole and that there were others far more guilty
than he. What affected him most was the entire separation from his
people. He was taken back to prison in November, 1874, and four
years later, refusing to live longer in confinement, he committed suicide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
by throwing himself from an upper story of the prison, October 11, 1878
(<cite>Whatley letter</cite>).</p>

<p>Set-t'aiñte, whose name among the Kiowa is still one to conjure by,
first acquired his title of "Orator of the Plains" in connection with the
events which led to the treaty of Medicine Lodge, in 1867. He was
already sufficiently distinguished among his own people as a leader on
the warpath. In May preceding the treaty he visited Fort Larned,
and, confronting General Hancock, he denounced agent Leavenworth
and complained of the aggressions of the white men in a fiery speech,
which is described as a masterly effort, from its opening, when he called
the sun to witness that he would "talk straight," to the close, when,
looking around over the prairie, he said that it was large and good, and
declared that he did not want it stained with blood.</p>

<p>A few months later he escorted General Harney and the commissioners
from the post to the spot where the Indians were gathering for the
treaty. In spite of stringent orders before starting, the soldiers and
camp followers soon began an indiscriminate slaughter of the buffalo
along the line of march. As described by a correspondent&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They recklessly shot down the buffalo, simply that they might boast of it. After
cutting out their tongues, they left the carcasses where they fell. The reader will
readily perceive that when the Indians complain at every council of the decrease
of the buffalo, such wanton waste of good meat could not be a pleasing sight to
the greatest chief on the American plains. Satanta, never backward in speech,
resented in strong terms the shooting of his game on his own ground. Said he,
while his eyes flashed and his lips curled with scorn: "Has the white man become a
child, that he should recklessly kill and not eat? When the red men slay game, they
do so that they may live and not starve." Sound logic! Only persons devoid of
sense or honor could have been guilty of such conduct in the enemy's country, especially
when the commissioners were endeavoring to conciliate them with presents
and reconcile them to the propositions about to be propounded.</p></blockquote>

<p>The protest had its effect, no more shooting was allowed, and those
responsible for the outrage were placed under arrest.</p>

<p>On behalf of the confederate tribes, he made the leading speech in
reply to the commissioners. It is thus given by the correspondent of
the New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You, the commissioners, have come from afar to listen to our grievances. My heart
is glad, and I shall hide nothing from you. I understood that you were coming down
to see us. I moved away from those disposed for war, and I also came along to see
you. The Kiowas and Comanches have not been fighting. We were away down
south when we heard, you were coming to see us. The Cheyennes are those who
have been fighting with you. They did it in broad daylight so that all could see
them. If I had been fighting I would have done it by day and not in the dark.
Two years ago I made peace with Generals Harney, Sanborn, and Colonel Leavenworth
at the mouth of the Little Arkansas. That peace I have never broken. When
the grass was growing in the spring, a large body of soldiers came along on the
Santa Fé road. I had not done anything and therefore I was not afraid. All the
chiefs of the Kiowas, Comanches, and Arapahos are here today; they have come to
listen to good words. We have been waiting here a long time to see you and are
getting tired. All the land south of the Arkansas belongs to the Kiowas and
Comanches, and I don't want to give away any of it. I love the land and the buffalo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
and will not part with it. I want you to understand well what I say. Write it on
paper. Let the Great Father see it, and let me hear what he has to say. I want
you to understand also, that the Kiowas and Comanches don't want to fight, and
have not been fighting since we made the treaty. I hear a great deal of good talk
from the gentlemen whom the Great Father sends us, but they never do what they
say. I don't want any of the medicine lodges [schools and churches] within the
country. I want the children raised as I was. When I make peace, it is a long and
lasting one&mdash;there is no end to it. We thank you for your presents. All the headmen
and braves are happy. They will do what you want them, for they know you
are doing the best you can. I and they will do our best also. When I look upon
you, I know you are all big chiefs. While you are in this country we go to sleep
happy and are not afraid. I have heard that you intend to settle us on a reservation
near the mountains. I don't want to settle. I love to roam over the prairies.
There I feel free and happy, but when we settle down we grow pale and die. I have
laid aside my lance, bow, and shield, and yet I feel safe in your presence. I have told
you the truth. I have no little lies hid about me, but I don't know how it is with
the commissioners. Are they as clear as I am? A long time ago this land belonged
to our fathers; but when I go up to the river I see camps of soldiers on its banks.
These soldiers cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo; and when I see that, my
heart feels like bursting; I feel sorry. I have spoken."</p>

<p>The above is a plain unvarnished statement of facts, such as no Indian on the
plains could produce but Satanta. It must be remembered that in cunning or native
diplomacy Satanta has no equal. In worth and influence Red Cloud is his rival;
but in boldness, daring, and merciless cruelty Satanta is far superior, and yet there
are some good points in this dusky chieftain which command admiration. If a
white man does him an injury, he never forgives him; but if on the other hand the
white man has done him a service, death can alone prevent him from paying the
debt. The speech of Satanta caused the commissioners to look rather blank, and
when he pictured in his usual graphic manner how he loved his land, his buffalo,
and his traditions, there was a world of feeling in his tones, betraying his knowledge
of the vast difference between the power of the aggressive pale face and his waning
race. A certain dim foreboding of the Indian's fate swept across his mind, and in
its passage lit his eyes up with a fierce light, and his voice rose to a pitch of frenzy
as he exclaimed: "We don't want to settle&mdash;I love to roam over the prairie; there I
am free and happy."</p></blockquote>

<p>His farewell speech, to the commissioners at the conclusion of the
treaty is thus noted in the same newspaper:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On this occasion the old chief was accompanied by one hundred of the principal
warriors of the Kiowa tribe; and immediately after its close, this tribe, as well as
the Comanches, struck camp and left for the Cimarron River in the south. He
spoke with a gravity and earnestness that added force to his words. "If," said he,
"the treaty bring prosperity to us, we of course will like it the better. If it bring
prosperity or adversity, we will not abandon it." He alluded delicately to the fact
that the white man often forgot to keep his treaties with the Indian; and then at
the close, referring to the treaty just made, he rose to the heights of friendship,
offering his heart and his hospitality, and adding: "For your sakes, the green grass
shall not be stained with the blood of the whites. Your people shall again be our
people, and peace shall be our mutual heritage. Good-bye. You may not see me
again. But remember Satanta as the white man's friend." He is spoken of as having
a very grave yet musical voice, and at times displays the deepest emotion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another who heard him on this occasion says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The great chief, Satanta, in delivering his address spoke with a dignity and force
that could not but be appreciated. He is a great orator and of unbounded influence
in the council (<cite>Ind. Miscel., xii, 3804&mdash;3833</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>He is thus described by Keim in 1870:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For several years Satanta has filled the office of head chief. A peculiar dash of
manner; a grin equal to all occasions; a remarkable shrewdness exhibited in managing
affairs between the different tribes with which his people come in contact, or
their intercourse with the national government, have won for him a prestige which
he has very well maintained. Satanta, when I first met him, was a man of about
fifty years of age. He rose first through prowess on the warpath, and afterward
through skill in council and diplomacy. He had an intelligent face, and was large
in frame and of muscular development, exhibiting also a tendency to obesity.
Lately Satanta has found a threatening rival in Lone-wolf, the war chief of the
tribe (<cite>Keim, 3</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Three years later we get the following notice from one who saw him
with Big-tree, in 1873, while serving his first incarceration in the Texas
penitentiary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the corridor of the penitentiary I saw a tall, finely-formed man, with bronzed
complexion, and long, flowing, brown hair, a man princely in carriage, on whom even
the prison garb seemed elegant, and was told that it was Satanta, the chief of the
Kiowas, who with his brother chief, Big-tree, is held to account for murder. I was
presently introduced to a venerable bigamist who was Satanta's chosen boon companion,
on account of his smattering of Spanish, and through this anxious prisoner
was presented at court. Satanta had come into the workroom, where he was popularly
supposed to labor, but where he never performed a stroke of work, and had
seated himself on a pile of oakum, with his hands folded across his massive chest
[<a href="#fig150">figure 150</a>]. His fellow prisoner explained to Satanta, in Spanish, that we desired
to converse with him, whereupon he rose and suddenly stretching out his hand
gave mine a ponderous grasp, saying: "How!" He then responded, always through
the aged wife-deceiver, to the few trivial questions I asked, and sat down, motioning
to me to be seated with as much dignity and grace as though he were a monarch
receiving a foreign ambassador. His face was good; there was a delicate curve of
pain at the lips, which contrasted oddly with the strong Indian cast of his other
features. Although he is much more than 60 years old, he hardly seemed 40, so
erect, elastic, vigorous was he. When asked if he ever expected liberation, and
what he would do if it should come, he responded, "Quien sabe?" with the most
stoical indifference. Big-tree was briskly at work plaiting a chair seat in another
apartment and chewing tobacco vigorously. His face was clear cut and handsome,
his coal black hair swept his shoulders, and he only paused to brush it back and
give us a swift glance as we entered, then briskly plaited as before (<cite>Scribner, 1</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The particular offense for which Set-t'aiñte was first arrested was a
raid upon some teamsters on Salt creek, Jack county, Texas. In
response to a letter of inquiry, the following concise statement in regard
to his prison life and tragic death was obtained from Mr L. A. Whatley,
superintendent of Texas penitentiaries, writing from Huntsville,
under date of March 3, 1896:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the July term of the district court of Jack county, in the year 1871, Satanta
was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Texas state penitentiary.
He was received at the Huntsville prison on the 2d of November, 1871.
Upon the recommendation of President U. S. Grant, Governor E. J. Davis, on August
19, 1873, set Satanta at liberty upon parole, i. e., conditioned upon his good behavior.
It seems, however, that he violated his parole, for he was arrested and recommitted
to the prison at Huntsville by Lieutenant General Sheridan on the 8th of November,
1874. On October 11, 1878, Satanta committed suicide by throwing himself from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
second story of the prison hospital, from the effects of which he died within a few
hours. He was buried at the prison cemetery, where his grave can be identified to
this day. During the period of his incarceration in this prison Satanta behaved
well, but was very reticent and stoical.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the end of the man who had said: "When I roam over the
prairie I feel free and happy, but when I sit down I grow pale and die."</p>

<p>Set-t'aiñte was distinguished by his war paint, which was red, his
face, hair, and the upper part of his body being painted red, his tipi
also being painted entirely red, with streamers of the same color at the
ends of the poles. He carried a ceremonial "medicine lance," feathered
like an arrowshaft, which seems to have been an ancient heirloom from
the Crows. He had a grim sort of humor, rather characteristic of his
tribe. At a council held at Fort Dodge in the spring of 1867 he was
presented by General Hancock with a full suit of general's uniform,
and showed his appreciation of the gift by leading an attack on the
post shortly afterward arrayed in his new toggery (<cite>Custer, 2</cite>). This
attack was probably in fulfillment of a promise made a few months
before, when it is said he sent a message to the commander of the post
saying that his stock was getting poor&mdash;this was in winter&mdash;and he
hoped the government animals at the post would be well fed, as he
would be over in a short time to get them (<cite>Report, 46</cite>). He left a son,
who inherited his father's name and shield, as well as his bold hawk-like
features. This is the young man mentioned by Custer in his "Life
on the Plains." He enlisted in the Indian troop at Fort Sill, and on
his death in 1894 made a formal will, giving his father's shield to Captain
H. L. Scott, of the Seventh cavalry, commander of the troop, in
whose possession it now is. The representation here given (plates
<a href="#LXII">LXII</a>, <a href="#LXIII">LXIII</a>) is made by his permission. A sister of the elder Set-t'aiñte
still lives, and, with a friendly, hospitable disposition, seems to combine
many of her brother's strong traits of character. Since the death
of the younger Set-t'aiñte the name is tabooed, in accordance with
tribal custom, and the chief is referred to only under his boy name of
Gúatoñ-bain, "Big-ribs."</p>

<h5 id="PROGRESS_OF_THE_CAMPAIGN">PROGRESS OF THE CAMPAIGN</h5>

<p>The campaign against the hostiles was now pressed vigorously. A
large force of troops under Colonel (now Major-General) Nelson A. Miles
started from Fort Supply toward the southwest to strike the enemy in
the direction of the Antelope hills, while a smaller body from New
Mexico, under Major W. R. Price, moved down the South Canadian to
assist him. On August 30 Miles encountered the Indians in force near
the head of the Washita, and after a running fight, lasting several days,
drove them out on the Staked plain, with a loss of several killed,
besides a considerable portion of their horses and camp outfit. A few
days later the supply train in charge of Captain Wyllis Lyman, Fifth
infantry, was attacked near the head of the Washita. The men corralled
the wagons, and defended themselves for several days until relief
arrived from Fort Supply. On September 12 the detachment under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Major Price had a severe encounter with a large force of Indians
between Sweetwater creek and the Washita, on the eastern boundary
of the Panhandle, but finally repulsed them, pursuing them several
miles. The assailants were supposed to have been the Kiowa who
had recently stampeded from the Wichita agency (see the <a href="#d1874_75">calendar
1874&mdash;75</a>; also <cite>Record, 4</cite>; <cite>War, 3</cite>).</p>

<p class="caption">OUTSIDE OF SET-T'AIÑTE'S SHIELD.</p>
</div>

<p>On September 26 and 27, 1874, Colonel (afterward General) Ranald
S. Mackenzie, Fourth cavalry (<i>Mángomhéñte</i>), "No index-finger," on
account of the loss of that finger), whom the Comanche already knew
to their sorrow, with a detachment of his regiment, after repelling two
attacks, surprised a large body of Cheyenne and their allies in a canyon
near Red river, Texas, destroying over a hundred tipis and capturing
their entire camp outfit, with over fourteen hundred horses and mules.
This was the severest blow the Indians had yet received. On October
9, Colonel George P. Buell, Eleventh infantry, struck and destroyed a
large Kiowa camp on the Salt fork of Red river, and eight days later
Captain Adna R. Chaffee, Sixth cavalry, surprised and destroyed
another camp north of the Washita, the Indians fleeing without attempting
a defense (<cite>Record, 5</cite>).</p>

<p>As a result of these successive losses the Indians became discouraged,
and early in October the Comanche sent messengers asking permission
to come into the agency. Permission being given, Täbinä´naka, White-wolf,
and Red-food, with their people, started in and were met on Elk
creek by a detachment from Fort Sill, under Major G. W. Schofield,
who received their surrender and brought them in to the fort. Others
came in a few days later and surrendered, making in all about four
hundred Indians with about two thousand horses. Other Comanche
and Kiowa in small parties continued to come in, the men being imprisoned
under guard as fast as they arrived. Big-bow was allowed to go
back to induce the Kiowa to come in, and was successful, returning in
February, 1875, with Lone-wolf, Red-otter (<i>Apeñ-gúădal</i>), Swan (<i>Tsä´dal-t'aiñ</i>),
Dohásän, and Poor-buffalo, and their people, who were met on
their way in by the interpreter, Philip McCusker, and some friendly
Comanche, to whom they surrendered their arms and horses. Poor-buffalo
and his band had been enrolled among the friendlies, but had
fled at the time of the agency fight. This left only a few of the Kiowa
out, and these also came in soon after. In the meantime small bodies
of Cheyenne were coming in and surrendering at their agency, but the
main body still remained out (<cite>Report, 47</cite>; <cite>Record, 6</cite>).</p>

<p>On November 6 a small detachment of the Eighth cavalry under
Lieutenant H. J. Farnsworth had a fight with about a hundred of the
Cheyenne on McClellan creek, Texas, in which several were killed and
wounded on both sides. Two days later Lieutenant Frank D. Baldwin,
with some of the Fifth infantry and Sixth cavalry, attacked a camp of
Cheyenne near the same place and rescued two little white girls named
Germaine, who had been captured more than a year before. The pursuit
was continued by another detachment under Captain Charles D.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Viele, Tenth cavalry. On November 28 Captain Charles A. Hartwell,
Eighth cavalry, again encountered and defeated the Cheyenne on Muster
creek, Texas. Several other skirmishes occurred during the month,
in each of which the Indians&mdash;chiefly Cheyenne&mdash;were the losers, and
on the 28th of December Captain A. B. Keyes, of the Tenth cavalry,
succeeded in capturing, on the North Canadian, an entire band of that
tribe, with all their ponies, after having followed them 80 miles. Most
of the operations during October and November were by troops from
Fort Sill under command of Lieutenant-Colonel John W. Davidson,
Tenth cavalry, commanding officer of the post (<cite>Record, 7</cite>).</p>

<h5 id="SURRENDER_OF_THE_CHEYENNE">SURRENDER OF THE CHEYENNE</h5>

<p>The campaign was vigorously prosecuted during the winter and into
the spring of 1875. The forces engaged consisted of eight troops of the
Sixth cavalry under Majors Charles E. Compton and James Biddle,
four troops of the Eighth cavalry under Major Price, and four companies
of the Fifth infantry, the whole under the immediate command of
Colonel (now Major-General) Nelson A. Miles. During this period the
troops were constantly engaged in scouting over the territory involved,
keeping the Indians so constantly on the move that they were unable
to lay in any stock of provisions. This active work was continued by
the troops upon the exposed and barren plains of that region during
a winter of unprecedented severity, and as the season advanced, the
difficulty of supplying the necessary forage and subsistence increased
so that no little hardship and privation resulted, but the troops bore
everything with fortitude and without complaint. By extraordinary
effort enough supplies reached the troops to enable them to remain
in the field until their work was done, and at length, early in March,
1875, the southern Cheyennes, completely broken down, gave up the
contest, and under their principal chief, Stone-calf, the whole body of
that tribe, with a trifling exception, surrendered themselves as prisoners
of war. At the same time they restored the two elder captive Germaine
girls. They gave up also their horses, bows and arrows, with
some guns, but secretly hid most of their valuable firearms (<cite>Record, 8</cite>).</p>

<p>The main body of the Cheyenne surrendered to Lieutenant-Colonel
Thomas H. Neil, Sixth cavalry, near the agency (Darlington), on March
6, 1875, and were at once disarmed and placed under guard, their
ponies being confiscated and sold. Their agent says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A more wretched and poverty-stricken community than these people presented
after they were placed in the prison camp it would be difficult to imagine. Bereft
of lodges and the most ordinary cooking apparatus; with no ponies nor other means
of transportation for food or water; half starved and with scarcely anything that
could be called clothing, they were truly objects of pity; and for the first time the
Cheyenne seemed to realize the power of the government and their own inability to
cope successfully therewith (<cite>Report, 48</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 27th of April they were formally transferred from the charge
of the military to that of the agent and declared to be again at peace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
with the government. Throughout this whole period the Arapaho
camped near the agency, in spite of short rations and all the other
difficulties of their position, had maintained untarnished their treaty
obligations.</p>

<h5 id="PRISONERS_SENT_TO_FLORIDA">PRISONERS SENT TO FLORIDA</h5>

<p>It had been determined, on the surrender of the hostiles, to select
some of the most prominent leaders from each tribe concerned for a
term of confinement at some military prison in the east. Accordingly
thirty-three of the Cheyenne were selected, with two Arapaho, who,
though not concerned in the outbreak, had been guilty in other ways.
Among the Cheyenne selected was one woman, who was identified as
having participated in the murder of the Germaine family. While
ironing the prisoners on April 6, a young warrior named Black-horse,
stung by the taunts of the women, kicked over the blacksmith and
attempted to escape, but was immediately shot down by the guard.
The Cheyenne at once attacked the guard with guns and arrows. A
troop of cavalry was quickly ordered up from Fort Reno, 2 miles
away, when the Cheyenne fled to the sandhills on the river bank across
from the agency, where they had secreted a quantity of firearms and
ammunition, and, digging pits in the sand, opened fire on the troops.
A severe engagement ensued, the Indians holding their position until
dark, several being killed or wounded on each side. During the night
they fled, and when daylight came nothing remained of the prison camp
but a few worn-out tipis. Most of the Indians soon afterward surrendered;
but a band of about sixty, including the murderers of the Germaine
family, attempted to escape to the Dakota country, and had made
their way to the vicinity of Fort Wallace, Kansas, when they were intercepted
by a detachment under Lieutenant A. Henley, Sixth cavalry,
who cut off about half of them from the rest. On their refusal to surrender,
he attacked them and killed nineteen, captured over one hundred
and twenty-five ponies, and burned their camp, with the loss of
two soldiers killed. The remainder escaped to the northward. The
thirty-five Cheyenne and Arapaho prisoners selected for imprisonment
were sent to Fort Marion, near St Augustine, Florida (<cite>Record, 9</cite>;
<cite>Report, 49</cite>).</p>

<h5 id="THE_GERMAINE_FAMILY">THE GERMAINE FAMILY</h5>

<p>The Germaine girls referred to were part of a family of that name
who had been attacked by the Cheyenne at their home on Smoky
Hill river, Kansas, on September 13, 1874. The father, mother, brother,
and one sister were killed, and four other sisters carried off, two of
whom were young women. On November 8, 1874, the two little girls,
aged five and seven, were rescued by Lieutenant Baldwin, as already
noted, in an encounter on the edge of the Panhandle. The two elder
sisters were held until the Cheyenne under Stone-calf surrendered,
after having been prisoners nearly seven months, during which time
they had suffered all the horrors of Indian captivity. General Miles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
became the guardian of all four, a comfortable home was provided for
them at Fort Leavenworth, and Congress authorized the stoppage of
an amount sufficient for the support of the children from the annuities
of their captors, the southern Cheyenne. A woman identified by them
as having taken part in the murder was sent with the other prisoners
to Florida (<cite>Record, 10</cite>; <cite>Report, 50</cite>).</p>

<p>Atrocities were, however, not confined to one side. In April, 1875, a
party of Texans attacked six Comanche, killing four men and a woman,
only one man escaping. The dead Indians, including the woman, were
beheaded, and the heads carried to the nearest town, where they were
said to have been preserved in alcohol (<cite>Report, 51</cite>).</p>

<h5 id="SURRENDER_OF_THE_COMANCHE">SURRENDER OF THE COMANCHE</h5>

<p>In response to overtures made through scouts Stilwell and Kilmartin,
another party of Comanche, numbering nearly two hundred, partly
Kwáhadi, came into Fort Sill in April and surrendered to Colonel
(General) R. S. Mackenzie, who had succeeded Colonel Davidson in
command of the post, delivering up their arms and over seven hundred
horses and mules. Soon afterward Mackenzie sent another message
to the Kwáhadi Comanche, Quanah's band, through Dr J. J. Sturm,
an experienced frontiersman. He found them near the head of Red
river and succeeded in persuading them to return with him to Fort
Sill, where they arrived on June 2, 1875, and surrendered their arms
and over fifteen hundred head of stock. The band numbered over four
hundred, including a few Apache. These were practically the last of
the hostiles, and thus the outbreak came to a close about a year after
it had begun. Although the Indians had become impoverished by loss
of stock and camp equipage, their loss in killed was very small. Only
about twenty were captured, the remainder having surrendered voluntarily
(<cite>Report, 52</cite>).</p>

<p>About thirty-five hundred horses and mules had been surrendered
by the Kiowa and Comanche when they came in. Of these nearly
eight hundred were shot, one hundred were given to the Tonkawa scouts,
several hundred more were given to the military scouts or were stolen,
some were returned to their owners, and about sixteen hundred were
sold for the benefit of the Indians, realizing about $22,000, which Colonel
Mackenzie decided to invest in sheep and goats, with the intention
of converting them into pastoral tribes like the Navaho (see the
<a href="#d1875_76">calendar, 1875&mdash;76</a>). The first horses surrendered had been shot before
this economic idea occurred to anyone. In addition to their losses by
the surrender, about two thousand horses and mules had been stolen
by Texas horse thieves from the friendly Indians camped near the
agency (<cite>Report, 53</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="PROPOSITION_TO_DEPORT_HOSTILE_TRIBES">PROPOSITION TO DEPORT HOSTILE TRIBES</h4>

<p>As a means of rendering the late hostiles forever harmless, and compelling
them to give up their nomadic hunting life and settle down to
earn their own living, it was proposed to deport several thousands of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
them, practically about all of the Cheyenne, Comanche, and Kiowa
tribes, to a remote district, where they were to be disarmed, dismounted,
and compelled to work in return for the supplies to be furnished by
the government. Congress having appropriated funds for the purpose,
arrangements were made with the Quapaw in April, 1875, by special
agent Major C. F. Larrabee for the purchase of a portion of their reservation
in the northeastern corner of Indian Territory. Preparations
were commenced for their removal, but in consequence of an adverse
report made by the commissioner appointed to remove them, the plan
was abandoned (<cite>Report, 54</cite>).</p>

<p>As had been done in the case of the Cheyenne and Arapaho, a
number of the Kiowa and Comanche were selected from among the late
hostiles and sent about the first of May, 1875, to join their predecessors
in military confinement at Fort Marion, Florida. It is somewhat of a
coincidence that the exiled Apache of Geronimo's band who were
removed from Arizona as prisoners of war in 1886 to the same Fort
Marion are now located at Fort Sill, upon the Kiowa reservation, to
which, point they were brought, in September, 1894, after a temporary
sojourn at Mount Vernon Barracks, Alabama. Nine Comanche and
twenty-six Kiowa were selected, making, with the Cheyenne and Arapaho,
a total of seventy prisoners sent to Florida. Of the Kiowa the
most prominent were Lone-wolf, Swan, Woman-heart, and White-horse,
the last named being selected on account of his previous record as a
notorious raider, although he had been enrolled with the friendlies
during the outbreak (<cite>Report, 55</cite>). It was of course the intention to
select for punishment those who had been most conspicuous or guilty
in the outbreak, but the selection being left principally to Kicking-bird,
that chief, with a natural desire to shield his friends, picked out
only a few of the prominent leaders, making up the quota with Mexican
captives and young men of no great reputation. Following is the list
of Florida prisoners from the Kiowa tribe, as furnished by the Indians:</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Gui-pägo</i>, "Lone-wolf," head chief and adopted father of the present head chief
of the same name.</li>

<li><i>Mäñyí-ten</i>, "Woman-heart," a chief and signer of the Medicine Lodge treaty.</li>

<li><i>Tseñ-t'áñte</i>, "White-horse," a chief.</li>

<li><i>T'ené'taide</i>, "Bird-chief," a chief.</li>

<li><i>Tsädal-t'aiñ</i>, "White-goose," i. e. "Swan," a chief.</li>

<li><i>Paä´ti</i>, "Buffalo-bull's-entrails," a chief.</li>

<li><i>Mamä´nte</i>, "Walking-above," alias <i>Dahä´ti</i>, "Medicine-man," a chief and noted
medicine man&mdash;died in Florida.</li>

<li><i>Gui-bótte</i>, "Wolf-stomach"&mdash;died in Florida.</li>

<li><i>É'pea</i>, "We-(they)-are-afraid-of-him"&mdash;died in Florida.</li>

<li><i>Gobe</i>, "Wild-horse."</li>

<li><i>Zon-k'ía</i>, "Tooth-man," alias <i>Kíñasáhe-k'ia</i>, "Green-shield-man"&mdash;died in
Florida.(?)</li>

<li><i>Etälyidónmo</i>, "He-(they?)-hunts-for-boys."</li>

<li><i>Máñ-kopédal</i>, "Flat-nose"&mdash;dead.</li>

<li><i>Set-mänte</i>, "Bear-above," or "Sky-bear"&mdash;dead.</li>

<li><i>T'enépíabi</i>, "Hummingbird"&mdash;still living; now a policeman.</li>

<li><i>Woháte</i>, "Cow" (<i>jargon</i>)&mdash;still living.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></li>

<li><i>Pä´da-i</i>, "Twin"&mdash;still living.</li>

<li>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; ("Double-vision"&mdash;Report, 56).</li>

<li><i>P´ódal-â´dalte</i>, "Snake-head," alias <i>Zoñtam</i>, "Hole-bite" (Paul Zotom)&mdash;still
living.</li>

<li><i>Set-k´opte</i>, "Mountain-bear" (Paul Saitkopeta)&mdash;still living.</li>

<li><i>Belo</i> (i. e., <i>Pedro</i>)&mdash;a Carrizo Indian captive from Mexico, still living.</li>

<li><i>Bíako</i> (Viejo?)&mdash;a Mexican captive, still living.</li>

<li><i>Päli</i> (Valdez?)&mdash;a Mexican captive, still living.</li>

<li><i>Añgáite</i>, "Ankle"&mdash;a Mexican captive, still living.</li>

<li><i>Bóloi</i>&mdash;a Mexican captive, still living.</li>

<li><i>Goho</i>, "Kick"&mdash;a Mexican captive, still living.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is notable, as showing the comparative vitality of the races under
new conditions, that of the twenty Indians on the list only five are
still alive, and one of these is dying of slow consumption, while all of
the six Mexican captives are still in vigorous health. Of the twenty
Kiowa and Comanche who signed the treaty of 1867 only two were
alive in 1896.</p>

<p>The prisoners while in Florida were merely kept under surveillance
and were not subjected to close confinement. Philanthropic white
people took an interest in them, especially in the younger ones, and
undertook to give them rudimentary instruction in civilization and
Christianity. When they were finally released in May, 1878, a number
of the young men consented to remain a few years longer in the east to
acquire an education, among whom were eight of the Kiowa. Those
who were not taken into private families were placed in the Normal
Institute at Hampton, Virginia, originally established for the education
of negroes. Soon after, fifty other young Indians were assembled
at Hampton, which thus became also an Indian school. The success
of this experiment led to the establishment of the Indian school at
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 1879 (<cite>Report, 57</cite>).</p>

<p>Several of the young Kiowa were received in refined and philanthropic
families in the north, with the purpose of educating them to
be missionaries among their people on their return. One of these, Paul
Zotom (Zoñtam), was regularly ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal
church. (<cite>Report, 58</cite>). He returned in the summer of 1881, but has sadly
fallen from grace. Another, Paul Saitkopeta (Setk'opte), after similar
careful training in a refined family with the same purpose in view,
returned a year later nearly dead from consumption contracted in the
east, and although of more manly character than Zotom is now almost
helpless for any practical purpose, being a confirmed invalid, and has
reverted to many of the Indian customs. Setk'opte is a Kiowa by
adoption only, being the son of a Cheyenne chief by a Pawnee captive
woman.</p>

<h4 id="KICKING-BIRD">KICKING-BIRD</h4>

<p>The noted chief, T'ené-angópte, "Kicking-bird," who had been so
long a leader of the peace element among his people, died suddenly on
May 5, 1875. It was suspected at the time, and is still believed by
some of the tribe, that he had been poisoned by his enemies of the war
party, but although the matter was investigated it could not be proven.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Like so many others of the Kiowa, he was of mixed origin, his paternal
grandfather having been a Crow captive taken when a boy and adopted
into the tribe. Although a young man, he had a commanding influence
among his people, and on the failure of the war party under Lone-wolf
became recognized as the principal chief of the Kiowa. An untaught
savage, he was yet a man of fine native ability and thoroughly
versed in the traditions and ceremonials of his people. Recognizing
early the inevitable changes consequent upon the advent of the white
man, he deliberately abandoned the warpath and addressed himself to
the task of preparing his people to meet the new conditions. From that
time forward his voice and example were always on the side of peace
and civilization. By this course he drew upon himself the hatred of
the conservatives and the war party, who denounced him as a coward
and a traitor, charges which he met and refuted in characteristic
fashion. When the question of peace or war came to a final issue in
1874, his powerful influence held more than two-thirds of the Kiowa
from the warpath, and by his exertions afterward he secured the best
possible terms for the defeated hostiles. It was by his invitation and
assistance that Battey organized the first school in the tribe in 1873.
His last counsel to his people was to remain at peace with everybody
and to follow the advice of their teachers, and he declared that he was
dying "holding on to the white man's hand." At the request of his
family, Agent Haworth took charge of his body and gave it Christian
burial, this being the first instance of the kind in the history of the
tribe (<cite>Report, 59</cite>; <cite>Battey, 11</cite>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His long-continued attachment to the whites at one time so far brought him into
disrepute with his tribe that they charged his friendship to cowardice, called him a
woman, and refused to listen to his counsels. Finding his influence in the tribe
nearly gone, he raised a force, conducted a raid into Texas, and had a severe engagement
with the white soldiers, where he led his men with such ability and coolness as
to come off victorious and win a testimony of respect from the commander of his
enemy's forces. On his return home he again advocated peace with the whites, and
has steadily continued to do so from that time to the present. The tribe, thoroughly
convinced of his bravery, no longer attribute his desire for peace to cowardice, and
listen to his eloquent arguments, in most cases yielding to his counsels; so that he
really stands at the head of all those Kiowa who are disposed to live peaceably, as
Lone-wolf does at the head of those occupying a less friendly position (<cite>Battey, 12</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Another characteristic incident is recorded by Battey. Shortly before
the outbreak some trouble occurred between Kicking-bird and
the chiefs disposed to hostility, who accused him of having lied about
them. A meeting was arranged at the agency to talk it over, and as
the Indians were greatly excited some trouble was anticipated. When,
the Kiowa began to arrive, each as he entered the office and seated
himself strung his bow and placed it where it could be instantly seized
for action, put his quiver of arrows in convenient position, also placing
three or four arrows across his lap, loosened his revolver, and turned
the handle ready for grasping, while many of them trembled with
excitement. When the room was nearly filled, Kicking-bird, accompanied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
only by his brother and another friend, rode up coolly, as if unaware
of what might be going on inside. Securing their ponies, they
entered the office, Kicking-bird in advance. Looking around the circle,
he took in the situation at once, and seating themselves, he and his
companions coolly proceeded to place their bows, arrows, and revolvers
in the same position for convenient use if necessary. Then addressing
the agent, Kicking-bird informed him of the charges against himself
(Kicking-bird), and called upon him to keep back nothing that he had
told him, but to tell his people his whole talk (<cite>Battey, 13</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="CHANGED_CONDITIONS">CHANGED CONDITIONS</h4>

<p>With the close of the outbreak and the subsequent readjustment of
affairs came a great change in the condition of the Kiowa and their
confederated tribes. The old chiefs who had so often led them on the
warpath were dead or in prison; their horses, which to prairie warriors
were almost as essential as the bow or rifle, had been taken from them,
together with their weapons; military posts and garrisons had been
established in their midst and the chain of white settlements had been
drawn closer around them; their old allies, the Cheyenne, had been
rendered powerless to help them, and, more than all, their unfailing
commissary, the buffalo, had practically disappeared. They felt that
they were powerless in the hands of the stronger race, and with a deep
sigh of regret for their vanished sovereignty they literally put their hands
to the plow and endeavored in their weak fashion to follow the white
man's road. The warriors, realizing that their time was too short to
learn new ways, were anxious to see their children prepared to meet
the changed conditions, and in consequence the schools were soon
crowded, some of the chiefs even assisting the teachers in the work of
organizing. Henceforth we find them trying to follow the new path
with patient resignation, in spite of difficulties and frequent neglect,
with only occasional weak ebullitions of the old fighting temper when
aroused by some particularly aggravated grievance.</p>

<h4 id="EPIDEMICS_OF_MEASLES_AND_FEVER_IN_1877_FIRST_HOUSES_BUILT">EPIDEMICS OF MEASLES AND FEVER IN 1877&mdash;FIRST HOUSES BUILT</h4>

<p>In 1877 an epidemic of measles in the tribe carried off a large number
of children. It was followed immediately afterward by an outbreak
of fever. In the fall of the same year the government, through agent
Haworth, built a number of houses for the prominent chiefs, these
being the first Indian houses on the reservation (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).
In accordance with a new plan of employing Indians at agencies, a
police force of about thirty natives was organized in 1878. The result
in this as in all other cases has been eminently satisfactory (<cite>Report, 60</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="AGENCY_REMOVED_TO_ANADARKO_THE_LAST_OF_THE_BUFFALO">AGENCY REMOVED TO ANADARKO&mdash;THE LAST OF THE BUFFALO</h4>

<p>For years Indians and agents alike had complained of the location
of the agency at Fort Sill. In consequence of repeated representations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
of the matter, it was removed toward the close of 1879 to
Anadarko on the Washita and consolidated with the Wichita agency
at that point, where it still remains (<cite>Report, 61</cite>). As a result, the
Kiowa, who had previously been together in a single camp on Cache
creek below the fort, now began to scatter and take up individual farms
along the Washita and on the creeks north of Mount Scott. This
year may be taken as the date of the disappearance of the buffalo
from the Kiowa country, the Indians during the summer of 1879 being
reduced to the necessity of killing and eating their ponies to keep
from starving, in consequence of the almost total failure of their annual
hunt (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>). Thereafter the appearance of even a single
buffalo was a rare event.</p>

<p class="caption">SET-ĬMKÍA OR STUMBLING-BEAR (PUSHING-BEAR).</p>
</div>

<p>In the same year died Lone-wolf, the principal chief and leader of the
war element in the late outbreak. Dohásän, Set-ängya, and Set-t'aiñte
being already gone, his death may be said to mark the end of the
war history of the Kiowa. Shortly after his return from Florida he
had conferred his name and succession upon the present bearer of the
name, who had been the comrade of his son, killed in Texas, although
not related by blood. The succession is now disputed by Ä´piatañ, the
nephew of the first Lone-wolf.</p>

<h4 id="THREATENED_OUTBREAK_INSTIGATED_BY_DATEKAN">THREATENED OUTBREAK INSTIGATED BY DÁTEKÂÑ</h4>

<p>In June of 1881 there was considerable excitement caused by threats
of an outbreak by the Kiowa on account of dissatisfaction with the
rations. Their attitude became so threatening that the more peaceable
Wichita and associated tribes became alarmed, and troops were sent
from Fort Sill to prevent trouble, which had the effect of quieting the
unrest (<cite>Report, 62</cite>). It is possible that the Kiowa were instigated
to this course by Dátekâñ, who soon afterward began preaching the
return of the buffalo and the old Indian life (see the <a href="#d1882">calendar, 1882</a>).</p>

<h4 id="EPIDEMIC_OF_1882_BEGINNING_OF_CHURCH_WORK">EPIDEMIC OF 1882&mdash;BEGINNING OF CHURCH WORK</h4>

<p>In the fall of 1882 the tribe suffered from an epidemic of whooping
cough and measles (<cite>Report, 63</cite>). In 1883 the first church was built
at the agency by Reverend J. B. Wicks of the Episcopal church, who
had been conducting missionary work among the associated tribes for
about two years previously. It was built and supported, however, by
the Wichita and affiliated tribes, the Kiowa and Apache as yet taking
little interest in such matters (<cite>Report, 64</cite>). The work was abandoned
shortly after and not resumed until 1887, when the Methodists entered
the field, followed later by the Presbyterians, Baptists, and Catholics.</p>

<h4 id="LEASING_OF_GRASS_LANDS">LEASING OF GRASS LANDS</h4>

<p>For some time various agents had called attention to the fact that
the Indians had a large surplus of valuable grass lands, which might
be made to yield them a considerable income if leased to cattlemen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
The suggestion being approved by the department, an arrangement
was made with several large cattle firms. The first money payment to
the Indians under this agreement was made in the summer of 1885, but
only to the Comanche, as the Kiowa and Apache for a year longer
refused to accept the money, believing this to be a scheme to deprive
them of their lands. There is no official notice of this at the time, for
the reason that the arrangement was at first only a matter of tolerance
and mutual agreement between the Indians and cattlemen, without
formal official recognition or responsibility for several years afterward.</p>

<h4 id="PA-INGYA_THE_MEDICINE-MAN_AND_PROPHET">PÁ-IÑGYA, THE MEDICINE-MAN AND PROPHET</h4>

<p>In the spring of 1887 a prophet named Pá-iñgya, "In-the-middle,"
revived the doctrine which had been taught five years before by Dátekâñ
of the speedy return of the buffalo and the revival of the old
Indian life, adding the usual accompaniments of invulnerability for his
followers and the destruction of the whites and unbelieving Indians by
fire and whirlwind. He claimed also the power to resurrect the dead
and to destroy his enemies with a glance as by a lightning stroke.
His preaching aroused great excitement among the Kiowa, and nearly
the entire tribe was soon enrolled among his adherents, including every
prominent chief except Stumbling-bear and Sun-boy. He established
headquarters on Elk creek, at the extreme western end of the reservation,
to which all his followers repaired. Here, by the friction of a
stick upon a block of wood, he kindled a sacred fire, from which the
devotees took brands to light and warm their tipis, being commanded
to throw away the white man's matches or flint and steel, together with
the white man's dress and weapons. As the day appointed for the final
cataclysm approached, the Indians took their children from the schools
at the agency in order that they might escape the destruction which
was soon to overwhelm the intrusive race, and left in a body for the
rendezvous on Elk creek. The movement alarmed the whites, who saw
that there was trouble brewing, but could get no explanation of the
reason. In anticipation of an outbreak, the agent, Captain Hall, summoned
the troops to his assistance. With a small escort he visited the
prophet's camp, and through the medium of Stumbling-bear invited
the chiefs to a conference, with the result that the Kiowa agreed to
return to their homes and await developments. As the time came and
went without supernatural event, they became satisfied that the
prophecy was a delusion, and the excitement died out. Pá-iñgya still
lives, and when the messiah revelation spread among the southern
tribes a few years later he hailed it as the delayed fulfillment of his
own prophecy (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<h4 id="INDIAN_COURT_ESTABLISHED">INDIAN COURT ESTABLISHED</h4>

<p>As a practical step toward educating the Indians in civilized forms
of self-government and to save the time consumed by the agent and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
other officials in trivial concerns, an Indian court consisting of three
judges was organized upon the reservation in 1888 for the trial of minor
offenses and questions, the first judges appointed being Quanah, Lone-wolf,
and Tawákoni Jim, head chiefs respectively of the Comanche,
Kiowa, and Wichita (<cite>Report, 65</cite>). This court is still in successful
operation.</p>

<h4 id="INTERTRIBAL_COUNCIL_OF_1888">INTERTRIBAL COUNCIL OF 1888</h4>

<p>The questions of railroads through the reservations, intrusions,
allotments, and the ultimate opening of Indian Territory to white settlement,
had now assumed such proportions that the civilized tribes
had become alarmed and had called an intertribal council to debate
measures to meet the emergency. The council met at Fort Gibson, in
the Cherokee nation, in June, 1888, with representatives of about
twenty tribes in attendance. Although recognizing civilization as
their ultimate destiny, they were strongly opposed to any change in
the tribal holding of their lands, and the sentiment was practically
unanimous against allotment or any disturbance of the existing tribal
system. The delegates and speakers from the Kiowa and associated
tribes were Täbinä´naka and White-wolf for the Comanche, Big-tree for
the Kiowa. White-man for the Apache, and Caddo Jake for the Caddo,
Wichita, and smaller bands (<cite>Report, 66</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="DEATH_OF_SUN-BOY_THE_LAST_SUN_DANCE">DEATH OF SUN-BOY&mdash;THE LAST SUN DANCE</h4>

<p>In the fall of 1888 died Pai´-tälyi´, "Sun-boy," one of the last of the
prominent chiefs of the old days of the buffalo hunt and the warpath
(see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>). The summer of 1890 is notable for the last sun
dance (<i>k`adó</i>) undertaken by the tribe. On this occasion the agent,
making objection to the ceremony, which the Indians refused to abandon,
ordered out the troops from Fort Sill to prevent it. On their
arrival, although the Kiowa were at first disposed to resistance, upon
the advice of Stumbling-bear and some other of the cooler heads, they
finally dispersed to their homes, leaving the unfinished medicine lodge
standing (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<h4 id="GHOST_DANCE_INAUGURATED_APIATANS_JOURNEY_IN_1890">GHOST DANCE INAUGURATED&mdash;ÄPIATAÑ'S JOURNEY IN 1890</h4>

<p>In the fall of 1890 Sitting-bull (Hänä´chä-thíak), an Arapaho, came
and inaugurated the ghost dance among the Kiowa. As this subject
is treated at length in the author's work on "The Ghost-dance Religion,"
in the Fourteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology,
it need only be mentioned here. Like all the neighboring tribes
except the Comanche, the Kiowa went heart and soul into the new
religion, which was in line with the previous prophecies of Dátekâñ
and Pá-iñgya. A few months later they sent Ä´piatañ, "Wooden-lance,"
a prominent young man of the tribe, to find the messiah and investigate
and report upon his doctrine. On his return in the following
spring he denounced the new teacher as an impostor, whereupon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
Kiowa abandoned the dance. Within the last two years, however, they
have revived the ghost-dance ceremonies with all the old-time vigor (see
the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<p>In the same winter, in January, 1891, three boys ran away from the
government school at the agency in consequence of the harshness of a
teacher, and a day or two later were found frozen to death in the mountains,
having been overtaken by a blizzard while attempting to reach
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
their homes. The affair naturally created intense excitement in the
tribe and threats were made against the teacher who was responsible
for the occurrence, but the matter finally quieted down without the
necessity of calling on the troops (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<h4 id="ENLISTMENT_OF_INDIANS_AS_SOLDIERS">ENLISTMENT OF INDIANS AS SOLDIERS</h4>

<p>In March, 1891, the Secretary of War authorized the enlistment of
an Indian contingent for each of the cavalry and infantry regiments
serving in the west. In pursuance of this plan, a troop was enlisted
from among the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes in the fall of
1891 and placed under the command of Lieutenant (now Captain) H. L.
Scott, and designated as troop L, of the Seventh cavalry, then stationed
at Fort Sill. Of this troop probably two-thirds were Kiowa
and Apache. The experiment did not prove satisfactory, and all of
the Indian companies have now been disbanded. The Kiowa troop
maintained its existence longest, under Captain Scott, who was
peculiarly fitted for the position by his intimate and sympathetic acquaintance
with Indian habit and belief and his expert knowledge of
the sign language. For this reason he has several times been selected
by the War Department to investigate threatened troubles among the
associated tribes, particularly during the critical period of the ghost
dance, and has also been selected by the Indians themselves to represent
their interests at Washington (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>; also <cite>War, 4</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="MEASLES_EPIDEMIC_OF_1892_GRASS_LANDS_LEASED">MEASLES EPIDEMIC OF 1892&mdash;GRASS LANDS LEASED</h4>

<p>The year 1892 was signalized by several important events. Early in
the spring an epidemic of measles broke out among the children in the
Kiowa school. Instead of isolating and nursing the sick, the superintendent
in charge sent the infected children home to their camps, thus
spreading the disease broadcast, resulting in the death of about two
hundred and twenty persons, nearly all children, among the Kiowa and
Apache, or fifteen per cent of the entire number. The superintendent
was soon afterward removed. This epidemic was the most terrible
calamity that has befallen the tribe in many years. Every family lost
relatives, and in addition to the large number of deaths thousands of
dollars' worth of property, in the form of horses, wagons, blankets, etc,
was destroyed at the graves in accordance with the Indian custom
(see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

<p>As by this time the Indians had learned that the leasing of their
grass lands would be a substantial benefit to themselves, they held a
joint council in the spring of the same year and authorized Quanah,
Lone-wolf, and White-man, head chiefs of the three confederate tribes,
to go as delegates to Washington, where they succeeded in negotiating
leases for nearly all of their surplus grass lands for an aggregate
annual rental of nearly $100,000. This money, with that received by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
the Indian soldiers, has been invested largely in houses and improved
stock. Today probably half the Indians of the three tribes are owners
of houses paid for with their own money (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).</p>

</div>

<h4 id="COMMISSION_FOR_ALLOTMENT_OF_LANDS_PROTEST_AGAINST_DECISION">COMMISSION FOR ALLOTMENT OF LANDS&mdash;PROTEST AGAINST DECISION</h4>

<p>In the autumn of 1892 a commission, which had already concluded
agreements with several other tribes, visited the Kiowa, Comanche, and
Apache to negotiate with them for the distribution of individual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
allotments and the sale of the remainder of their reservation. As the
terms of the Medicine Lodge treaty, under which they hold their present
reservation, do not expire until August 25, 1898, the Indians were
opposed to any change in the existing conditions, but by bringing strong
pressure to bear upon them, an agreement was finally reached by which
the reservation was to be thrown open immediately upon the ratification
of the contract by Congress. On learning the true nature of the instrument,
the Indians denounced the interpreter and demanded that their
names be stricken from the paper. This being refused, they repudiated
in council the action of the chiefs who had signed, and elected other
representatives to go to Washington to protest against the whole
proceeding. The delegates chosen were Ä´piatañ, already mentioned,
Apache John (<i>Goñk'oñ</i>, "Stays-in-tipi") and Piänä´vonĭt, "Big-looking-glass,"
for the Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche, respectively, with Captain
Scott, U. S. A., and Andres Martinez (<i>Ä´ndali</i>), an influential Mexican
captive among the Kiowa, as interpreter. The delegation arrived in
March, 1894, and made such representation of the matter that no action
was taken upon the agreement, and it is still unratified.</p>

<h4 id="PRESENT_CONDITION_AGENTS_IN_CHARGE_OF_CONFEDERATE_TRIBES">PRESENT CONDITION&mdash;AGENTS IN CHARGE OF CONFEDERATE TRIBES</h4>

<p>Realizing that a change is inevitable in the near future, the Indians
are going to work, and with the aid of the money received for their
grass lands invested in houses, cattle, and improved breed of horses, the
opening of small farms, and the general educational work of the schools,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
there is a fair prospect that at the expiration of their present treaty in
1898 they will be able to meet the new conditions (see 52d Cong., 2d
sess., Senate ex. doc. 17&mdash;Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache Agreement;

<p>Following are the names of the agents who have been in charge

<h3 id="SOCIOLOGY_OF_THE_KIOWA">SOCIOLOGY OF THE KIOWA</h3>

<h4 id="ABSENCE_OF_THE_CLAN_SYSTEM">ABSENCE OF THE CLAN SYSTEM</h4>

<p>The clan system does not exist among the Kiowa, and there is no
evidence that they have ever had it. This may be a surprise to those
disciples of Morgan who have assumed that because the system is
found among the eastern tribes and certain tribes of the southwest and
extreme northwest it is therefore universal and a necessary factor in
tribal development. It is by no means universal, and it is doubtful if
it exists among the Athapascan tribes of British America, the tribes
of the Columbia region, Oregon, or California, or any of the recognized
Shoshonean stock with the exception of the Hopi. The Cheyenne
and Sioux of the plains seem to know as little of it as do the Kiowa.
Clark, in his "Indian Sign Language," says: "I cannot help feeling that
Mr Morgan's careful study of the form of government of the Iroquois
league colored his writings in regard to all other Indians. Certain it is
that no trace now exists of such organization among many of the plains
tribes." In another place he states that among the majority of the
plains tribes, and perhaps the western Indians generally, judging from
their laws of inheritance and marriage customs, the system never did
exist (<cite>Clark, 5</cite>). Gatschet, in his great work on the Klamath language,
declares that the Klamath Indians of Oregon are absolutely ignorant
of the clan system, while Hale, in the "Iroquois Book of Rites,"
takes the ground that the system is simply an artificial invention,
adopted for convenience and spreading from various local centers. In
support of the idea that it is artificial rather than natural he points
out the fact that it is not found among the Polynesian tribes, who are
on about the same plane of development as our Indians (<cite>Hale, 1</cite>).
In the United States the clan system seems to be found more particularly
among the agricultural tribes.</p>

<h4 id="LOCAL_DIVISIONS">LOCAL DIVISIONS</h4>

<p>Before they were confined to the reservation the Kiowa were grouped
into two general local divisions, known, respectively, as <i>T'ó-k`íñähyup</i>,
"cold men" (i.e., men of the cold, or northern, country), and <i>Gwáhalégo</i>,
from the Comanche name Kwáhadi or Kwáhari. These terms
were practically equivalent to "northern" and "southern," the former
ranging chiefly along Arkansas river and the Kansas frontier, while
the latter, as the name indicates, associated more with the Kwáhadi
Comanche of the region of the Staked plain. As they were merely
temporary local designations and not proper band or gentile names,
they have now ceased to be of any practical importance.</p>

<h4 id="SUBTRIBES">SUBTRIBES</h4>

<p>The Kiowa have six recognized divisions or subtribes, including the
Apache, who form a component part of the Kiowa tribal circle. The
extinct K'úato formerly made a seventh, but their position in the circle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
is now forgotten. These divisions are not clans or gentes (social) based
on marriage regulations, but subtribes (political), each division having
had originally its own chief, subordinate to the recognized head
chief of the tribe, with certain peculiarities of dialect and sometimes
its special "medicine" or religious ceremonial. They may have been
in the beginning distinct cognate tribes, with the exception of the
Apache, which confederated at a later period for mutual assistance.
The Comanche, although now allied with the Kiowa, have no part in
their tribal organization or ceremonies.</p>

<h4 id="THE_CAMP_CIRCLE">THE CAMP CIRCLE</h4>

<p>The names of the bands and their order in the camp circle on the
occasion of all tribal gatherings are as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>K`at'a</i>, "Biters," i. e., Arikara. This is the largest and most important
division, occupying the first place in the camp circle, immediately
south of the door or entrance. To it belonged Dohásän, the great
chief who ruled the Kiowa for more than thirty years. To his family
was assigned the hereditary duty of furnishing the buffalo for each
annual sun dance. At present the K`at'a may be said to constitute the
aristocracy of the tribe. The name is said not to indicate an admixture
of Ree or Arikara blood, but simply a more intimate trading
association with that tribe in early days. As this association was
comparatively modern, the word may be a substitute for another name
discarded, in accordance with a Kiowa custom, in consequence of the
death of some noted individual of the same name. They are sometimes
called <i>Gâ´i-K`at'a</i>, "Kiowa K`at'a," to distinguish them from the
Arikara proper.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ko gúi</i>, "Elk." This band took the lead in war ceremonials.
A`dáte, whose camp was surprised and destroyed by the Osage in
1833, was its chief. Set-t'aiñte and the first Big-bow also belonged to
this band.</p>

<p>3. <i>Gâ´-igwû</i>, "Kiowa proper." This may have been the original nucleus
of the Kiowa tribe, as the name would seem to imply. Although
not numerous, they are held in much respect, are the keepers of the
<i>taíme</i>, and have charge of the <i>K`ado Dó</i>, or priestly tipi, at the sun-dance
ceremony. The western side of the circle properly belongs to
them, but in consequence of their small number individuals of other
bands sometimes camp with them.</p>

<p>4. <i>Kiñep</i>, "Big Shields." To them belonged the <i>gadómbitsóñhi</i> image
or idol, now lost, which was exposed in front of the <i>taíme</i> image at the
annual sun dance.</p>

<p>5. <i>Semät</i>, "Thieves," i. e., Apache. Although a distinct tribe, they
have formed an integral part of the Kiowa tribal circle from the earliest
traditionary period.</p>

<p>6. <i>Koñtä´lyui</i>, "Black Boys," or <i>Síndiyúi</i>, "Sindi's children." No
reason is assigned for either of these names, which are about equally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
common, Sindi is the great mythic hero of the Kiowa. They are a
small band, and occupy the last place in the circle.</p>

<p>7. <i>K'úato</i> "Pulling Up." These were exterminated by the Dakota
about 1780, as already related. They spoke a peculiar dialect of Kiowa.
It is not now known what position they occupied in the tribal circle.</p>

<p>Clark mentions four of these divisions, under the names of Elk
(<i>Kogúi</i>), Shield (<i>Kiñep</i>), Cut-Off (<i>K`at'a</i>), and Black (<i>Koñtälyui</i>), and
adds, "some claim five, the Apache Kiowa band" (<cite>Clark, 20</cite>).</p>

</div>

<h4 id="MILITARY_ORGANIZATION_YA_PAHE_WARRIORS">MILITARY ORGANIZATION&mdash;YÄ`´PÄHE WARRIORS</h4>

<p>The Kiowa have an elaborate military organization, now fast becoming
obsolete, known as <i>Yä´pähe</i>, "Warriors." A similar organization
is found among most of the prairie tribes, and is commonly known to the
whites as the Dog-soldier society, from an imperfect rendering of the
name of one of the principal bands. The Kiowa organization consists
of six orders, each having its own dance, songs, insignia, and duties.
The members were first enrolled as boys among the "Rabbits," and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
were afterward promoted, according to merit or the necessities of war,
in regular progression, to higher ranks. Only the bravest few, however,
ever attained the highest order, that of the <i>Kâ-itséñko</i>. Almost
every able-bodied man was enrolled. The orders, beginning with the
lowest, are as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Polä´ñyup</i> or <i>Tsä´ñyui</i>, "Rabbits." Boys above the age of eight
or ten years, who were drilled in their future duties as warriors by certain
old men. The step of their dance is intended to imitate the jumping
of a rabbit.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ädaltóyui</i> or <i>Téñbeyu´i</i>, "Young (wild) Sheep."</p>

<p>3. <i>Tseñtä´nmo</i>, "Horse Head-dresses." (?)</p>

<p>4. <i>Toñkóñko</i>, "Black Legs."</p>

<p>5. <i>T'äñpéko</i>, "Skunkberry People" or <i>Tséñ-â'dalka-i</i>, "Crazy
Horses."</p>

<p>6. <i>Kâ´-itsénko</i>, "Real or Principal Dogs (?)." These were the picked
men of the warriors and were limited to ten in number. According to
the myth, their founder saw in a vision a body of warriors dressed and
painted after the manner of the order, accompanied by a dog, which
sang the song of the Kâ´-itséñko and commanded him, "You are a dog;
make a noise like a dog and sing a dog song." Their peculiar insignia
and obligations will be described in another place (see the <a href="#d1846">calendar,
summer 1846</a>.)</p>

<p>Clark gives the names of the Kiowa orders as follows, omitting the
Poläñyup: Raven Soldiers or Black Leggings (<i>Toñkoñko</i>); Sheep
(<i>Ädaltóyui</i>); Feather Head (<i>Tseñtä´nmo</i>); Horse (<i>Kâ-itséñko</i>); War-club
(<i>T'äñpéko</i>). He adds, "The Kiowa Apache have only three bands,
viz: 1st, Big Horse; 2d, Raven; 3d, Swift Fox" (<cite>Clark, 6</cite>).</p>

<p>At home the Yä`pähe acted as camp police and leaders in the tribal
ceremonies; abroad they were the warriors and conductors of the hunt.
Battey gives an illustration of the system as he once saw it in practical
operation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Being determined that none of their thoughtless young men should go raiding in
Texas and thereby bring trouble upon the tribe, the Kiowas, immediately after the
whole tribe got together on Pecon creek, organized a military system, under the
control of the war chiefs, which was immediately put into operation. By this a
strong guard of their soldiers were continually watching day and night while in
camp to prevent any such enterprise from being undertaken. In moving from place
to place these soldiers marched on each side of the main body, while a front guard
went before and a rear guard behind, thus preventing any from straggling.</p>

<p>Their buffalo hunts were conducted in the same military order. The soldiers,
going out first, surrounded a tract of country in which were a large herd of buffalo,
and no one might chase a buffalo past this ring guard on pain of having his horse
shot by the soldiers. Within the ring hundreds of men on horseback were chasing
and shooting the huge creatures with revolvers or bows and arrows until each had
killed as many as his female attendants could skin and take care of (<cite>Battey, 14</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="HERALDIC_SYSTEM">HERALDIC SYSTEM</h4>

<p>In connection with their military and social organization the Kiowa
and Apache have a system of heraldry, which finds tangible expression
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
in the painting and ornamentation of their shields and tipis. There
were formerly about fifty shield patterns used in the two tribes, and
all the warriors carrying shields of the same pattern constituted a
close brotherhood, with similar war cries, body paint, and ceremonial
taboos and regulations. Every prominent family also had its heraldic
tipi, which occupied its fixed place in the tribal camp circle. Special
taboos and rules belonged to the tipi as to the shield, and the right of
hereditary descent was as nicely regulated as property ownership
among the whites. This system of heraldry will form the subject
of a future monograph.</p>

<h4 id="NAME_SYSTEM">NAME SYSTEM</h4>

<p>Their system of personal names is also interesting. All the names
have meaning and are as much a part of the owner as his hand or his
foot. Children are usually named soon after birth by one of the grandparents
or other relative not the parent; the name is commonly suggested
by some passing incident, but may be hereditary, or intended
to commemorate the warlike deed of some ancestor. In this way a
girl may bear a war name bestowed by her grandfather to preserve
the recollection of his own achievement. There are no ordinal names
as among the eastern Sioux, no clan names as among the Shawnee,
and no names which indicate the band of the individual. Young men
as they grow up usually assume dream names, in obedience to visions,
and these are sometimes superseded in later life by names acquired
on the warpath, the hunt, or in council. Frequently an aged warrior,
who feels that his day is near its close, formally gives his name to
some young man who seems to him to merit the honor; the older man
then assumes a new name, or more frequently lives out his remaining
years without a name, being referred to and addressed simply as "old
man." Sometimes the old warrior, having outlived the need of a name
and not regarding any younger man as worthy to bear it, deliberately
"throws it away" and is henceforth nameless. Should he die without
having bestowed his name upon a successor, the name dies with him
and can not be revived. The name of the dead is never spoken in the
presence of the relatives, and upon the death of any member of a
family all the others take new names&mdash;a custom noted by Raleigh's
colonists on Roanoke island more than three centuries ago. Moreover,
all words suggesting the name of the dead person are dropped
from the language for a term of years, and other words, conveying
the same idea, are substituted. The same custom exists among the
Comanche and perhaps among other tribes.</p>


<h4 id="MARRIAGE">MARRIAGE</h4>

<p>Marriage among the Kiowa, as among the plains tribes generally, is
a simple affair, with none of the elaborate ceremonials found among the
Hopi and other sedentary Indians. About all that is necessary is that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the maiden of the young man's choice shall be willing, and, this having
been ascertained by the lover, he sends some friend as a mediator to
her parents to make an offer of ponies or other property to compensate
them for the loss of their daughter. If both sides come to an agreement,
the match is made, and the young couple, with the assistance of
their friends, set up housekeeping on their own account. Compulsion
is no more brought to bear upon the girl than in civilized communities;
the brother of the girl has as much to do with the decision of the case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
as her parents, and continues to claim a sort of guardianship over her
even after her marriage. The marriageable age is about fourteen for
girls and sixteen for boys. In general the husband goes to live among
his wife's people instead of taking her to his own camp. The father
seems to exercise more control over his children than among tribes
having the clan system and mother right. There appears to be no fixed
rule of inheritance, but shield, tipi, and band name usually descend in
the male line. The husband avoids the mother-in-law, but not to the
same extent as among other plains tribes. Polygamy is allowed, but is
not frequent, only a few of the Kiowa now having two wives, and none
more than that number. In the old times it was more common, in consequence
of the surplus of women resulting from the killing off of the
men in their constant wars. The father of T'ebodal is famous for having
had ten wives; Quanah, the present head chief of the Comanche, has six.
It was common to marry sisters of the same family, and according to
tribal custom, which had analogy among the ancient Hebrews, the man
who married the eldest daughter had first claim upon her sisters.</p>

</div>

<p>Divorce is easy and without ceremony, but not so common as might
be supposed, there being many couples that have lived faithfully together
for nearly half a century. Adultery is punished by taking or destroying
the property of the guilty man. The woman is simply "thrown away"
by her husband, although in theory her life is forfeited. In former times
he might kill her or cut off her nose, as was done also among the neighboring
tribes, but this latter custom is now only a memory.</p>

<p>The tribal government was formerly committed to the care of a head
chief and the chiefs of the several bands, together with the war chiefs,
who had control in military affairs. Women had no voice in the government.
From the evidences of tradition and the statements of old
men, the chiefs in former times, before tribal customs were demoralized
by the advent of the conquering race, must have exercised almost
despotic powers and were feared as well as respected by their people.
Their last great chief was Dohásän, who died in 1866, since which time
no one has had the unquestioned allegiance of the whole tribe. The
present officially recognized head chief is Lone-wolf, the adopted son of
the hostile leader of the same name in the last outbreak. The elder
Lone-wolf formally bestowed his own name upon the younger man in
1879, thus publicly recognizing him as his successor. Camp and ceremonial
regulations were enforced and their violation punished by the
Yä'´pähe, acting under direction of the war chiefs. Personal grievances
were avenged by the injured party or by his nearest relatives, without
interference by the tribe.</p>

<h4 id="CHARACTER">CHARACTER</h4>

<p>In character the Kiowa are below the standard. Having been intimately
associated with them for some years, the author would be better
pleased to make a different showing, but truth compels the statement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
Tribal traits are strongly marked among Indians. The Sioux are direct
and manly, the Cheyenne high-spirited and keenly sensitive, the Arapaho
generous and accommodating, the Comanche practical and businesslike,
but the Kiowa, with some honorable exceptions, are deficient
in all these qualities. They have the savage virtue of bravery, as they
have abundantly proven, but as a people they have less of honor, gratitude,
and general reliability than perhaps any other tribe of the plains.
The large infusion of captive blood, chiefly Mexican, must undoubtedly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
have influenced the tribal character, but whether for good or evil the
student of heredity must determine.</p>

<p>The report of Captain Alvord, already quoted at length, affords a
good insight into Kiowa character. Gregg in 1844 described them as
"one of the most savage tribes that infest the western prairies" (<i>Gregg,
7</i>). Captain (afterward General) John Pope ten years later called them
deceitful and unreliable and "absolutely destitute of most of the chivalrous
characteristics which distinguish the Comanche brave." General
Pope in 1870 denounced them as being altogether the worst Indians the
government had to deal with, having been for twenty-five years past
"the most faithless, cruel, and unreliable of all the Indians of the
plains." About the same time General Sheridan expressed his lasting
regret that he did not hang Set-t'aiñte and Lone-wolf and punish the
whole tribe when he first met them. The Quaker Battey, a good friend
of theirs, describes them as "the most fierce and desperately bloodthirsty
tribe of the Indian Territory"&mdash;a people who had hitherto resisted
all attempts to bring them into friendly relations with the government
or to a knowledge of civilization, still continuing to commit depredations
upon the white settlements, stealing horses and mules, murdering men
and women and carrying their children into captivity. He says it
would probably be difficult to find in the whole tribe a man whose
hands had not been imbrued in blood. Clark states that in personal
appearance, intelligence, and tenacity of purpose he considers them
inferior to the Comanche (<cite>Pacific, 1</cite>; <cite>War, 5</cite>; <cite>Battey, 16</cite>; <cite>Clark, 8</cite>).</p>

<h4 id="POPULATION">POPULATION</h4>

<p>It is always difficult to estimate the population of a roving tribe, and
almost invariably first reports are greatly exaggerated. This is particularly
true of the Kiowa, whose restless disposition and inveterate
habit of raiding made them equally at home anywhere along a frontier
of a thousand miles. Excluding some extravagant early estimates, the
statements of the most competent observers, and the official reports
since they have been put upon the reservation, all indicate that the
combined population of the confederated Kiowa and Apache was never
much more than 1,600, or 1,800 at the greatest, of whom the Apache
numbered nearly one-fourth. No really accurate count was ever made
until after their final subjugation in 1875, and it is worth noting that
their numbers, which had been reported at 2,774 and 2,302 in the preceding
two years, at once fell to 1,414, and remained nearly stationary
at that figure until the epidemic of 1892. Battey's estimate in 1873 (in
which he probably means to include the Apache) of 1,600 to 1,650 is
probably very nearly correct. In 1892 the Kiowa numbered 1,014 and
the Apache 241, a total of 1,255, being a decrease from 1,476 in the
previous year in consequence of the epidemic of measles. In November,
1896, they numbered: Kiowa 1,065, Apache 208, a total of 1,273.
The associated Comanche at the same time numbered 1,545. In each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
of these tribes there is a large captive element of which, no separate
account is taken, but investigation would probably show that at least
one-fourth of the whole number have more or less of captive blood.
The captives are chiefly Mexicans and Mexican Indians, with Indians
of other tribes, and several whites taken from Texas when children,
including one old man who still remembers having gone to school in
Germany and having crossed the ocean with his parents (see Pope in
<cite>Pacific, 2</cite>).</p>

<p>Some of the estimates are based on the number of tipis or warriors,
an uncertain ratio, which varies greatly in different tribes. With the
Kiowa it may be assumed to equal 2 warriors and 6 or 7 souls to a tipi.
Below are given the various estimates and enumerations, beginning
with the earliest, that of Lewis and Clark in 1805. The estimates
of 1807, 1810, 1841&mdash;1845, and perhaps of 1850 probably include the
Apache.</p>

<h3 id="RELIGION_OF_THE_KIOWA">RELIGION OF THE KIOWA</h3>

<h4 id="SCOPE_OF_THEIR_BELIEF">SCOPE OF THEIR BELIEF</h4>

<p>In religion the Kiowa are polytheists and animists, deifying all the
powers of nature and praying to each in turn, according to the occasion.
Their native system has no Great Spirit, no heaven, no hell, although
they are now familiar with these ideas from contact with the whites;
their other world is a shadowy counterpart of this. There is an indistinct
idea of transmigration, owls and other night birds being supposed
to be animated by the souls of the dead, with a general belief
in ghosts, witches, and various sorts of good and bad "medicine."
Dreams and visions are supernatural revelations, to be trusted and
obeyed implicitly.</p>

<p>A curious instance of the persistence of the Indian beliefs in spite of
educational influences is afforded by the case of the late Kiowa interpreter,
a full-blood Indian, who had been reared and educated in the
east, graduated in theology, and was ordained to the ministry, married
a white woman, and returned as a missionary to his people. The Indians
accused him of deceiving them as to the terms of the treaty, and
told him that he "could not live," and he died shortly afterward in the
belief that he had been bewitched by the medicine-men as a punishment
for his part in the negotiations. The fact is a matter of official
record, as well as of contemporary newspaper publication.</p>

<h4 id="THE_SUN">THE SUN</h4>

<p>The greatest of the Kiowa gods is the Sun; by him they swear, to
him they make sacrifice of their own flesh, and in his honor they held
the great annual <i>k'ado</i> or sun dance. Next to the sun the buffalo
and the <i>señi</i> or peyote plant claim reverence, and these too may be
reduced to the same analysis, as the buffalo bull in his strength and
majesty is regarded as the animal symbol of the sun, while the peyote,
with its circular disk and its bright center, surrounded by white spots
or rays, is its vegetal representative. The <i>â'dalbeáhya</i> also derives
its origin from the sun. Unlike the agricultural tribes, they pay but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
little attention to the rain gods and seem to have no reverence for the
snake. Each shield order prays to some special deity, and every man
has also his own personal "medicine," somewhat like the guardian
angel or patron saint of the Catholic system. There are also supernatural
heroes, of whom the Sun-boy and Sindi are the greatest, with
ogres, dwarfs, water people, monsters, and all the other features of the
orthodox fairy book.</p>

<h4 id="OBJECTS_OF_RELIGIOUS_VENERATION">OBJECTS OF RELIGIOUS VENERATION</h4>

<p>Their most sacred objects of religious veneration are the <i>Â'dalbeáhya</i>,
the <i>Taíme</i>, the <i>Gadómbitsoñhi</i>, and the <i>señi</i> or peyote. Their great
tribal religious ceremony is the <i>k'ado</i> or. sun dance. Their tribal
religion is that which centers around the <i>â'dalbeáhya</i> and the <i>taíme</i>.
The worship of the peyote, although now general, excepting among
the oldest men, is comparatively modern with the Kiowa, having been
adopted from the more southern tribes. These two systems are compatible
and auxiliary to each other. In 1890 the new religion of the
ghost dance was introduced among the Kiowa. It is essentially different
from the older Indian systems and antagonistic to them, being
based on the doctrine of one God, although it preaches a return to the
old Indian life.</p>

<p>The <i>Â'dalbeáhya</i> (the word has some connection with <i>âdal</i>, "hair,"
and scalp) is the eucharistic body of their supernatural hero teacher,
the Sun-boy, and has been known among them almost from the beginning
of their existence as a people. According to the myth, which
has close parallels in other tribes, a girl was one day playing with
some companions when she discovered a porcupine in the branches of
a tree. She climbed up to capture it, but as she climbed the tree grew,
carrying her with it, until it pierced the arch of the sky into the upper
world; here the porcupine took on his proper form as the Son of the
Sun; they were married and had a son. Her husband had warned
her that, in her excursions in search of berries and roots, she must
never go near the plant called <i>äzón</i> (pomme blanche, <i>Psoralea esculenta</i>)
if its top had been bitten off by a buffalo. Like Eve, or Pandora, she
longed to test the prohibition, so one day while digging food plants
she took hold of a pomme blanche which a buffalo had already cropped
and pulled it up by the root, leaving a hole through which she saw
far below the earth, which she had forgotten since the day that she had
climbed the tree after the porcupine. Old memories awakened, and
full of an intense longing for her former home she took her child and
fastening a rope above the hole began letting herself down to the
earth. Her husband, returning from the hunt, discovered her absence
and the method of her escape, and throwing a stone after her through
the hole, before she had reached the end of the rope, struck her upon
the head and she fell to the ground dead. The child was uninjured, and
after staying some time beside the body of his mother he was found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
and cared for by Spider Woman, who became a second mother to him.
One day in playing he threw upward a gaming wheel, which came
down upon his head and cut through his body without killing him, so
that instead of one boy there were now twin brothers. After many
adventures, in the course of which they rid the world of several
destructive monsters, one of the brothers walked into a lake and disappeared
forever under its waters, after which the other transformed
himself into this "medicine," and gave himself in that shape to the
Kiowa, who still preserve it as the pledge and guardian of their
national existence. This <i>â´dalbeáhya</i>, or, as it is sometimes called,
the <i>tä´lyí-dá-i</i>, "boy-medicine," is in ten portions, in the keeping of
as many priests. Its chief priest is T'ébodal, the oldest man of the
tribe, with whom the author once had the opportunity of seeing the
pouch in which it is carried, for no man, unless possibly the priest
himself, has ever been permitted to open it and look upon the contents.
It is kept in a small pouch fringed with numerous scalps, in a special
tipi appointed for its residence; it is brought out for use in connection
with a sweat-house ceremony as individuals may desire to sacrifice to
it, and not, like the <i>taíme</i>, at tribal gatherings. It is briefly mentioned
by Clark in his work on the sign language (<cite>Clark, 7</cite>).</p>

<p class="caption">THE PORCUPINE IN THE TREE, AND FLIGHT OF THE SUN WOMAN (FROM THE NATIVE DRAWING.)</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Gadómbítsoñhi</i>, "Old-woman-under-the-ground," belonged to the
Kiñep band of the Kiowa. It was a small image, less than a foot
high, representing a woman with flowing hair. It was exposed in
front of the <i>taíme</i> at the great sun-dance ceremony, and by some
unexplained jugglery the priest in charge of it caused it to rise out of
the ground, dance in the sight of the people, and then again sink into
the earth. A few years ago it was stolen by a crazy Indian from the
priest who guarded it and has never since been recovered, although
there are stories in the tribe of hunters belated in the mountains, or
beside unfrequented streams, who have caught glimpses of a wailing
dwarf with disheveled hair who vanished as soon as discovered, and
is believed to have been the lost <i>gadómbítsoñhi</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Señi</i>, "prickly fruit," the peyote or mescal plant, is a small species
of cactus of the genus <i>Lophophora</i> (Coulter), which grows in the
stony hill country along the Mexican border. On account of its medical
properties and its wonderful effect upon the imagination, it is
regarded by the Indians as the vegetal incarnation of a deity, and a
whole system of myth and ritual has grown up in connection with its
use. The rite originated among the more southern tribes, and has
come through the Mescalero and Comanche to the Kiowa within about
fifty years. The ceremony was first brought to public notice by the
author and may be the subject of a more extended monograph at some
future time.</p>

<p>Another ritual, pertaining more particularly to women, was dedicated
to the Star Girls, or Pleiades (<i>Dä´-mä´tán</i>). Its last priestess died a
few years ago.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>The great, central figure of the <i>k`adó</i>, or sun dance, ceremony is the
<i>taíme</i>. This is a small image, less than 2 feet in length, representing
a human figure dressed in a robe of white feathers, with a headdress
consisting of a single upright feather and pendants of ermine skin,
with numerous strands of blue beads around its neck, and painted
upon the face, breast, and back with designs symbolic of the sun and
moon. The image itself is of dark-green stone, in form rudely resembling
a human head and bust, probably shaped by art like the
stone fetishes of the Pueblo tribes. It is preserved in a rawhide box
in charge of the hereditary keeper, and is never under any circumstances
exposed to view except at the annual sun dance, when it is
fastened to a short upright stick planted within the medicine lodge,
near the western side. It was last exposed in 1888 (see the <a href="#THE_KIOWA_CALENDARS">calendar</a>).
The ancient <i>taíme</i> image was of buckskin, with a stalk of Indian
tobacco for a headdress. This buckskin image was left in the medicine
lodge, with all the other adornments and sacrificial offerings, at
the close of each ceremony. The present <i>taíme</i> is one of three, two of
which came originally from the Crows, through an Arapaho who married
into the Kiowa tribe, while the third came by capture from the
Blackfeet.</p>

<p>The tobacco upon the head of the ancient <i>taíme</i> is another evidence
of the northern origin of the Kiowa, as the Kutenai, Blackfoot, and
other tribes living near and across the Canadian border are noted for
their cultivation of tobacco, and have a special tobacco dance and
ceremonies. The more remote tribes along the northwest coast are
equally celebrated for their carving in stone, the material used being
commonly a black slate, and the original stone <i>taímes</i> may have come
from that region.</p>

<p>According to the legend, which is told with the exactness of an historical
tradition, an Arapaho, who was without horses or other wealth,
attended with his tribe the sun dance of the Crows and danced long
and earnestly before the "medicine," in hope that it would pity him and
make him prosperous. The chief priest of the Crows rewarded him
by giving him the <i>taíme</i> image, notwithstanding the protests of the
Crows, who were angry at seeing such favor shown to a stranger.
Fortune now smiled upon the Arapaho; he stole many horses and won
new blessings for himself by tying numerous ponies to the medicine
lodge as a sacrifice to the <i>taíme</i>, until at last his herd was of the largest.
Being now grown wealthy, when next his own people visited the
Crows he collected his horses and started back with them, but the jealous
Crows followed secretly, untied the <i>taíme</i> bag from the pole in
front of his tipi and stole it, as Rachel stole her father's gods. On discovering
his loss the Arapaho made duplicates, which he took back
with him to his own people. He afterward married a Kiowa woman
and went to live with her tribe, bringing with him the <i>taíme</i>, which
thus became the medicine of the Kiowa. Since that time the <i>taíme</i> has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
been handed down in his family, the keeper being consequently always
of part Arapaho blood.</p>

<p class="caption">PEYOTE PLANT AND BUTTON.</p>
</div>

<p>The present guardian is a woman, Émaä, who succeeded to the office
on the death of Taíméte, "<i>Taíme</i>-man," in 1894; she is the ninth successive
guardian, the Arapaho being the first. The fifth keeper, Ánsogíani,
"Long Foot," or Ánso'te, held it forty years&mdash;from before the
Osage massacre until his death in the winter of 1870&mdash;71. Assuming
that the combined terms of the first four guardians equaled in time the
combined terms of the last four&mdash;i. e., about sixty or sixty-five years, or
from about 1830 to 1894&mdash;we would have 1770 as the approximate date
when the Kiowa obtained the present <i>taíme</i> image. As previously
stated, they already had the ceremony and an equivalent image of
buckskin. Of the two <i>taíme</i> images, both of which were of the same
shape and material, one, the "man," was small, only a few inches in
length, while the other, the "woman," was much larger. It is believed
among the Kiowa that the Crows still have the originals which they
stole from the Arapaho.</p>

<p>Long afterward, after the Kiowa had confederated with the Comanche,
the latter had a fight with the Blackfeet, in which they killed
a warrior and captured his medicine. The Comanche captor, so the
story goes, kept the medicine one night in his tipi, but it kept up a
strange noise, which so frightened him that the next day he gave it to
a Kiowa, who pulled off a long "tooth" attached to it, and thenceforth
it was silent. Learning afterward that it was a part of the <i>taíme</i>
medicine, he gave it to the <i>taíme</i> keeper, who put it with the other
images. It is said to have been nearly similar in appearance to the
smaller image.</p>

<p>The complete <i>taíme</i> medicine thus consisted of three decorated stone
images, a large one or "woman," a smaller one called a "man," and a
third one closely resembling the second. They were kept in a rawhide
case known as the <i>taíme-bíĭmkâ´i</i>, shaped somewhat like a kidney
(see figure, summer <a href="#d1835">1835</a>), and painted with <i>taíme</i> symbols, the large
image being in one end of the case and the two smaller ones at the
other; some say that the third image was kept in a separate box by a
relative of the <i>taíme</i> priest. The smaller images, like the ark of the
covenant, were sometimes carried to war, the box being slung from the
shoulders of the man who carried it, and consequently were finally
captured by the Ute. The large image, the "woman" <i>taíme</i>, was
never taken from the main home camp.</p>

<p>The <i>taíme</i> has been twice captured by enemies, first by the Osage
in 1833, and again by the Ute in 1868. In the first instance the Osage
surprised the Kiowa camp and captured all the images with the bag,
killing the wife of the <i>taíme</i> priest as she was trying to loosen it from
its fastenings, but returned it two years later, after peace had been
made between the two tribes (see the <a href="#d1833">calendar, 1833</a> and <a href="#d1835">1835</a>). In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
the other case the Kiowa had taken the two smaller images, as a palladium
of victory, upon a war expedition, when they were met by a war
party of Ute, who defeated them, killed the bearer of the medicine,
and carried off the images, which have never since been recovered.

<h4 id="TRIBAL_MEDICINES_OF_OTHER_INDIANS">TRIBAL MEDICINES OF OTHER INDIANS</h4>

<p>Nearly every important tribe, excepting perhaps those aboriginal
skeptics, the Comanche, has or did have a tribal "medicine" equivalent
to the <i>taíme</i>, around which centers the tribal mythology and ceremonial
with which the prosperity and fate of the tribe is bound up. With the
Cheyenne this is a bundle of sacred arrows, now in the keeping of one
of the southern bands near Cantonment, Oklahoma. With the Arapaho
it consists of a pipe, a turtle, and an ear of corn, all of stone, wrapped
in skins, and kept by the hereditary priest with the northern branch of
the tribe in Wyoming. Among the Omaha it was a large shell, now
preserved in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, Massachusetts.
With the Creeks it is a set of graven metal tablets, possibly relics of
De Soto's disastrous expedition through the gulf states, religiously
guarded by the priest of the Wind clan of the nation in Indian Territory.</p>

<h4 id="THE_SUN_DANCE">THE SUN DANCE</h4>

<p>The great tribal ceremony of the Kiowa was the <i>k`adó</i>, or sun
dance, which was commonly celebrated annually when the down appeared
on the cottonwoods, i. e., about the middle of June. In their
calendar system the summers are counted by <i>k`adós</i>, the winters being
designated as "cold seasons." On this occasion the whole tribe
encamped in a circle, each band in its appropriate place, with the
<i>k`adó</i> or medicine lodge in the center. Within the medicine lodge
the <i>taíme</i> was exposed during the continuance of the ceremony, which
lasted four days, although the preliminary buffalo hunt and other
necessary arrangements occupied much more time. Space forbids a
detailed account of the ceremony, which was common to most of the
prairie tribes, and has been described with more or less accuracy by
various writers. The Kiowa sun dance resembled that of the Dakota,
Cheyenne, and other tribes in its general features&mdash;the search for the
buffalo, the arrangement of the camp circle, the procession of the
women to cut down the tree for the center pole of the medicine lodge,
the sham battle for possession of the pole, the building of the medicine
lodge, and the four days' dance without eating, drinking, or sleeping.
It differed radically, however, in the entire absence of those voluntary
self tortures which have made the sun dance among other tribes a
synonym for savage horrors. With the Kiowa even the accidental
shedding of blood on such an occasion was considered an evil omen,
and was the signal for abandoning the dance; voluntary laceration by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
way of sacrifice was practiced at other times, but not at the <i>k'ado</i>.
Among the Kiowa the center pole must always be cut down by a captive
woman. On account of the dread in which the <i>taíme</i> is held, by
reason of the many taboos connected with it, they have also a captive,
taken from Mexico when a boy and given to the <i>taíme</i> for this special
purpose, to unwrap it and set it in place at the ceremonial exposure,
so that should any regulation be inadvertently violated, the punishment
would fall upon the captive and not upon the tribe. It is hardly
necessary to state that this Mexican captive has as perfect faith in the
<i>taíme</i> as the priestly keeper himself.</p>

<p>In the Sett'an calendar the summer is always designated by a rude
figure of the medicine lodge. On the Anko calendar the distinction is
made by the decorated center-pole of the lodge. Medicine-lodge creek,
where the famous treaty was negotiated, derives its name from several
medicine lodges formerly standing on its banks near the southern
Kansas line, this being a favorite spot for the sun dance with both the
Kiowa and Cheyenne. The following description of the medicine lodge
is from Battey's account of the Kiowa sun dance witnessed by him in
1873, to which account the reader is referred (<cite>Battey, 15</cite>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The medicine house is situated nearly in the center of the encampment, is circular
in form, and about 60 feet in diameter, having its entrance toward the east. It is
built by erecting a forked post, 20 feet high, perhaps, for a central support; around
this, and at nearly equal distances, are 17 other forked posts, forming the circumference
of the building. These are from 12 to 15 feet in height, and all of cottonwood.
Small cottonwood trees are tied on the outside of these, in a horizontal position,
with ropes of rawhide, having limbs and leaves on them. Outside of these small
cottonwood trees are placed in an upright position, thus forming a wall of green trees
and leaves several feet in thickness, in the midst of which many hundred spectators
afterwards found a cool retreat, where they could observe what was going on without
making themselves conspicuous. Long cottonwood poles extend from each of
the posts in the circumference to the central post, and then limbs of the same are
laid across these, forming a shady roof one-third of the way to the center.</p>

<p>The central post is ornamented near the ground with the robes of buffalo calves,
their heads up, as if in the act of climbing it. Each of the branches above the fork
is ornamented in a similar manner, with the addition of shawls, calico, scarfs, etc.,
and covered at the top with black muslin. Attached to the fork is a bundle of
cottonwood and willow limbs, firmly bound together and covered with a buffalo
robe, with head and horns, so as to form a rude image of a buffalo, to which were
hung strips of new calico, muslin, strouding, both blue and scarlet, feathers, shawls,
etc., of various lengths and qualities. The longer and more showy articles were
placed near the ends. This image was so placed as to face the east. The lodges of
the encampment are arranged in circles around the medicine house, having their
entrances toward it, the nearest circle being some 10 rods distant....</p>

<p>The ground inside the inclosure had been carefully cleared of grass, sticks, and
roots, and covered several inches deep with clean white sand. A screen had been
constructed on the side opposite the entrance by sticking small cottonwoods and
cedars deep into the ground, so as to preserve them fresh as long as possible. A
space was left, 2 or 3 feet wide, between it and the inclosing wall, in which the
dancers prepared themselves for the dance, and in front of which was the medicine.
This consisted of an image lying on the ground, but so concealed from view in the
screen as to render its form indistinguishable; above it was a large fan made of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
eagle quills, with the quill part lengthened out nearly a foot by inserting a stick
into it and securing it there. These were held in a spread form by means of a
willow rod or wire bent in a circular form; above this was a mass of feathers, concealing
an image, on each side of which were several shields highly decorated with
feathers and paint. Various other paraphernalia of heathen worship were suspended
in the screen, among these shields or over them, impossible for me to
describe so as to be comprehended. A mound had also been thrown up around the
central post of the building, 2 feet high and perhaps 5 feet in diameter.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="TRIBAL_SIGN_2">TRIBAL SIGN</h3>

<p>Right index finger rubbed briskly up and down along the back of
left index finger. This is the generic sign for all tribes of Apache connection,
including Apache proper, Navaho, Mescalero, Lipan, and Kiowa
Apache. It is commonly interpreted to mean "knife whetters" or "whetstone
people," and this is also the meaning of the generic term for Apache
in most of the plains languages. It is possible, however, that this is a
misconception of the original purpose of the sign, which may have had
reference to a peculiar musical instrument found in various forms
among the Pueblo and other Indians of the southwest. Clark says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have heard two distinct conceptions for this gesture, the Cheyenne claiming that
the sign came from a peculiar musical instrument made from an elk horn, which
produced weird-like sounds by rubbing it backward and forward with a stick, and
the second (I do not remember what tribe gave me the conception) from a specially
good whetstone which the Apaches made and used (<cite>Clark, 9</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>In a personal letter to the author Grinnell states, on Cheyenne
authority, that the sign "is not <i>whetting a knife</i>, which would be performed
by one open flat hand on back of other flat hand, and not <i>poor</i>,
which would be passing right forefinger down over back of left forefinger
held vertically. The sign is said by the Cheyenne to refer to a
musical instrument used in old times by the Apache. This instrument
was played by passing the forefinger back and forth over the flat surface
of the instrument, from which surface a tongue protruded, which,
when struck, vibrated and made the sound, somewhat after the manner
of the Jew's-harp."</p>

<h3 id="ORIGIN_AND_HISTORY">ORIGIN AND HISTORY</h3>

<p>The Kiowa Apache are a small tribe of Athapascan stock, numbering
now about two hundred and twenty-five, associated with the Kiowa
from the earliest traditional period and forming a component part of
the Kiowa tribal circle, although reserving their distinct language;
they call themselves <i>Nadíisha-dena</i>, "our people." In the early French
records of the seventeenth century, in Lewis and Clark's narrative, and
in their first treaty, in 1837, they are called by various forms of the
name <i>Gáta`ka</i>, the name by which they are known to the Pawnee,
although this does not necessarily imply that the word is of Pawnee
origin. They are possibly the Kaskaia or "Bad-hearts" of Long in
1820. The Kiowa call them by the contemptuous title of <i>Semät</i>,
"thieves," a recent substitute for the older generic term <i>Tagúi</i>, applied
also to other tribes of the same stock. They are now commonly known
as Kiowa Apache, under a mistaken impression, arising from the fact
of their Athapascan affinity, that they are a detached band of the
Apache nation of Arizona. On the contrary, they have never had any
political connection with the Apache proper and were probably unaware
of their existence until about one hundred years ago. A few Mescalero
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Apache from New Mexico are now living with them, and individuals of
the two tribes frequently exchange visits, but this friendly intimacy is
a matter of only sixty or eighty years' standing, resulting from the
peace between the Kiowa and Comanche, as already recorded.</p>

<p>They have not migrated from the southwest into the plains country,
but have come with the Kiowa from the extreme north, where they lay
the scene of their oldest traditions, including their great medicine story.
Their association with the Kiowa antedates the first removal of the
latter from the mountains, as both tribes say they have no memory of
a time when they were not together. It is probable that the Kiowa
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Apache, like the cognate Sarsi, have come down along the eastern base
of the Rocky mountains from the great Athapascan hive of the Mackenzie
river region instead of along the chain of the Sierras, the line
followed by the kindred Tototin, Wailaki, Navaho, and Apache proper,
and that, finding themselves too weak to stand alone, they took refuge
with the Kiowa, as the Sarsi have done with the Blackfeet.</p>

<p class="caption">KIOWA MIGRATION ROUTE.</p>
</div>

<p>In regard to this northern origin and early association Clark says,
in his valuable work on the sign language: "Tradition locates the
Kiowas near and to the southwest of the Black Hills, Dakota, and
without doubt they had previous to that time lived near the Missouri
river. The Apaches with whom they are now associated were at this
time with them." In another place he states that an old Apache told
him, about 1881, that he was then about seventy years of age and had
been born near Missouri river, northeast of the Black Hills (<cite>Clark, 10</cite>).
Keim chooses to call them Lipan, in which he is mistaken, the Lipan
being still another Athapascan tribe living farther south, and states
that "these people are improperly known as Apaches and so called in
the official documents of the government. They say of themselves
that they are not Apaches, that the Apaches live away to the west."
He says that they have a tradition of having formerly lived in the
Bad-lands of Dakota, whence they drifted to the south, but adds somewhat
naively that there is no other authority for this than their own
story (<cite>Keim, 4</cite>).</p>

<p>As the Apache are practically a part of the Kiowa in everything but
language, they need no extended separate notice. Curiously enough
their authentic history begins nearly seventy years earlier than that of
the dominant tribe with which they are associated. They are first
mentioned by the French explorer La Salle, in an undated letter of
1681 or 1682, under the name of Gattacka. Writing from a post in
what is now Illinois, he says that the Pana (Pawnee) live more than
200 leagues to the west, on one of the tributaries of the Mississippi,
and are "neighbors and allies of the Gattacka and Manrhoet, who are
south of their villages, and who sell to them horses, which they probably
steal from the Spaniards of New Mexico." In another fragmentary
letter of 1682, written from the same place, he proposes to make an
overland journey by means of horses, "which may easily be had, as
there are many with the savages called Pana, Pancassa, Manrhout,
Gataea, Panimaha, and Pasos, who lie somewhat remote, it is true, but
yet communication with them is very easy by means of the river of the
Missourites, which flows into the river Colbert" (<cite>Margry, 1</cite>). In modern
terms Pana, Pancassa (or Paneassa), Gataea (for Gataca), Panimaha,
Missourites, and Colbert are respectively Pawnee, Ponca (?),
Kiowa Apache, Pawnee-Maha or &mdash;&mdash;, Missouri, and Mississippi.
Paso is problematic, and Manrhoet or Maurhout, which in both letters
is mentioned in connection with the Kiowa Apache, may possibly be
some obsolete name for the Kiowa themselves.

<p>From these references it is plain that the Kiowa Apache&mdash;and presumably
also the Kiowa&mdash;ranged even at this early period in the same
general region where they were known more than a hundred years
later, namely, between the Platte and the frontiers of New Mexico, and
that they already had herds of horses taken from the Spanish settlements.
It appears also that they were then in friendship with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
Pawnee. From the fact that they traded horses to the other tribes,
and that La Salle proposed to supply himself from them or their neighbors,
it is not impossible that they sometimes visited the French fort
on Peoria lake. On a map in Harris' Collection of Voyages and Travels,
published in 1705, we find the "Gataka" marked&mdash;probably on the
authority of early French documents&mdash;on the west side of the Missouri,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
above the Quapaw (see the <a href="#TRIBAL_SYNONYMY_2">Kiowa Apache synonymy</a>, page <a href="#Page_245">245</a>). In
1719 La Harpe found them ("Quataquois") living in connection with
the Tawákoni and other affiliated tribes in a village which has been
identified by Philip Walker, Esquire, of Washington, as situated on the
south bank of the Cimarron, near its junction with the Arkansas, in
what is now the Creek nation of Indian Territory (<cite>Margry, 2</cite>).</p>

<h3 id="FIRST_OFFICIAL_AMERICAN_NOTICE">FIRST OFFICIAL AMERICAN NOTICE</h3>

<p>The official history of the Apache begins nearly a hundred years
later. In 1805 the explorers Lewis and Clark describe the "Ca´takâ,"
whom they apparently did not meet, as living between the heads of
the two forks of Cheyenne river, in the Black Hills region of northeastern
Wyoming, and numbering twenty-five tipis, seventy-five warriors,
and three hundred souls. This appears to be a singularly close
estimate. The Kiowa lived near them, on the North Platte, and both
tribes had the same alliances and general customs. They were rich
in horses, which they sold to the Arikara and Mandan, but had no
trader among them, and the mouth of Cheyenne river was suggested
as a suitable place for the establishment of a trading post for them
both (<cite>Lewis and Clark, 6</cite>).</p>

<h3 id="TREATIES">TREATIES</h3>

<p>In 1837, in connection with the Kiowa and Tawákoni, they made
their first treaty with the government, as has already been described
at length in treating of the Kiowa. They are called Kataka in the
treaty, this being apparently the last official use of that name, and
thenceforth they have been known as Apache. Their subsequent history
is that of the Kiowa. In 1853 they are mentioned as a warlike
band ranging the waters of Canadian river, in the same great plains
occupied by the Comanche, with whom they often joined in raiding
expeditions (<cite>Report, 67</cite>).</p>

<p>By the treaty of the Little Arkansas, in 1865, they were officially
detached from the Kiowa and attached to the Cheyenne and Arapaho.
This was done at the request of the Apache themselves, in consequence
of the unfriendly attitude of the Kiowa toward the whites. But the
arrangement had no practical force, and by the treaty of Medicine
Lodge, in 1867, they were formally reunited to the Kiowa. This latter
treaty was signed by six chiefs on behalf of the Apache, Gúañtekána,
"Poor-bear," being then their principal chief (see the treaty, <i>ante</i>). A
part of the Apache continued to live with the Cheyenne and Arapaho
until after the readjustment at the close of the outbreak of 1874&mdash;75. In
keeping with the general conduct of the tribe, they remained peaceable
and friendly throughout the trouble (<cite>Report, 68</cite>).</p>

<h3 id="DELEGATION_TO_WASHINGTON_1872_FRIENDLY_DISPOSITION">DELEGATION TO WASHINGTON, 1872&mdash;FRIENDLY DISPOSITION</h3>

<p>They participated with the Kiowa and others in the joint delegation
which visited Washington in October, 1872, being represented on that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
occasion by Pacer the principal chief, Daho, and Gray-eagle. In his
official report Captain Alvord, chairman of the commission which had
charge of the delegation, says of the Apache:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Apache who are in the Indian Territory number about five hundred, are recognized
by the supplemental treaty of 1867 as confederated with the Kiowa and
Comanche, and have generally been controlled by and acted with the Kiowa. More
or less of them have constantly participated in the marauding of the others, but as a
tribe or band it is believed that they are better disposed than their associates, and
that the professions of friendship which are made by their three principal chiefs,
now in Washington, are in good faith, and may be received accordingly. I think
that if they can be removed from the evil influences of the Kiowa and Comanche,
they will do well (<cite>Report, 69</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>On the return of the delegation the Apache in good faith commenced
to learn the ways of civilization and to earn their own living. Their
agent reports:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Apache were very attentive, working themselves with the hoe. Apache John,
a chief, is especially deserving of mention. He worked hard, had all the weeds hoed
out, and in addition, to his corn has a fine crop of watermelons, some of which he
brought me as a present. It was a very nice sight to see one who a few months ago
was regarded as a wild and dangerous man drive up in his wagon (I had given him
one) and unload from it a number of fine melons of his own cultivation and raising
(<cite>Report, 70</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The next year, 1874, started out with even more encouraging prospects.
The Apache chiefs worked in their own fields as an example to
their people, and at the request of Pacer a school was established
among them by A. J. Standing, who, like Battey and Haworth, was a
Quaker. All went well until summer, when the Cheyenne, Comanche,
and a part of the Kiowa took up arms in defense of their hunting
grounds, as already narrated, more or less involving the other tribes,
and putting a complete stop to the work of civilization. By direction
of the agent the Apache, at the beginning of the trouble, repaired to
the friendly camp at Fort Sill, where during all the disturbance they
maintained their loyalty and kept the peace, and afterward used their
good offices to bring about the surrender of the hostiles, as they had
done previously in 1869 (<cite>Report, 71</cite>).</p>

<p>Pacer, head chief of the Apache, died in the summer of 1875. He
was a man of considerable ability and is frequently mentioned in the
official reports of the period, as well as by Battey. He had been the
consistent advocate of friendly relations with the whites, and on his
death was given a civilized burial, at the request of his people, as had
been done in the case of Kicking-bird, the Kiowa chief, who died shortly
before (<cite>Report, 72</cite>).</p>

<h3 id="RECENT_HISTORY_AND_PRESENT_CONDITION">RECENT HISTORY AND PRESENT CONDITION</h3>

<p>The Apache participate with the Kiowa and Comanche in the benefits
of the leases of grass lands. They suffered terribly in the epidemic of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
1892, losing more than one-fourth of their number. They joined in the
protest against the late unratified agreement and were represented in
the joint delegation of 1894 by Goñkoñ, "Stays-in-tipi," or Apache
John. In dress, customs, and general characteristics they resemble the
Kiowa, but are much more agreeable and reliable in disposition. They
join with them in the sun dance and the peyote rite, and have no
distinct tribal ceremony of their own, although they have a "horse
medicine" of considerable repute. In 1896 they numbered two hundred
and eight, under the head chieftainship of White-man, and resided
chiefly on Apache creek and in the vicinity of the Kichai hills.</p>

winter of 1832&mdash;33, being an encounter with a small party of Americans,
resulting in the death of Gúi-kóñgya, "Black-wolf," and the capture
of a large quantity of silver coin. The winter is indicated according
to the regular system by a black bar below the principal figure, which

a man, the black wolf connected by a line expresses his name, while
the red spot with blood gushing from it between the shoulders shows
that he was shot through the body. Beside it is a very good picture
of a silver dollar to indicate the money captured. This last does not
appear on the Dohásän calendar, although the capture gives name to
the winter.</p>

</div>

<p>According to the Kiowa story, a war party led by Tóñp'ódal-kyä`tó,
"Lame-old-man," met a small train in charge of a few Americans close
to South Canadian river (<i>Gúădal P'a</i>, "Red river"), a short
distance below the entrance of a southern creek, which they call
<i>T'ä´ñpeä´ P'a</i>, "Skunkberry-bush river," about opposite the present
town of Lathrop, in the panhandle of Texas. They call Americans
<i>Hâñpóko</i>, "Trappers," for the reason that the first Americans known
to the tribe were trappers. Texans are considered as of a different
nation, and are distinguished as <i>Tehä´neko</i> from the Spanish
<i>Tejano</i>. In this instance the Americans were traveling eastward, and
as the place was remote from any regular trail the Indians were at a
loss to know why the whites were there. The Kiowa attacked the train,
killed several of the party, and captured the money, with the loss to
themselves of but one man, Gúi-kóñgya. They found a few coins upon
the ground, but this being the first money they had ever seen, they
did not know its proper use, and so beat the coins into disks to be
fastened to straps worn attached to the scalp lock, and hanging down
behind (hence the name for money, <i>â´dal-hâñ´gya</i>, literally "hair
metal"). After leaving the place they met some Comanche, who already
knew the use of money, and on hearing the story told them the value
of the silver pieces, upon which the Kiowa returned and searched
until they succeeded in finding a large quantity. From this it
appears that whatever trade the Kiowa had previously carried on with
the Spanish settlements had been by barter in kind, as was usual
along the Indian frontier in the early days. This was some time
before the beginning of regular intercourse with Americans.</p>

<p>Gregg, the author of a most valuable account of the early Santa Fé
trade, passed over the same ground a few years later and gives full
details of the affair with its tragic sequel. His description of the location
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
agrees with the Indian statement, and his account explains also
how the whites happened to be traveling in such an unfrequented place.
The Kiowa statement was obtained without any reference to Gregg.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was somewhere in this vicinity that a small party of Americans experienced a
terrible calamity in the winter of 1832&mdash;3 on their way home, and as the incident had
the tendency to call into play the most prominent features of the Indian character,
I will digress so far here as to relate the facts.</p>

<p>The party consisted of twelve men, chiefly citizens of Missouri. Their baggage
and about ten thousand dollars in specie was packed upon mules. They took the
route of the Canadian river, fearing to venture on the northern prairies at that season
of the year. Having left Santa Fé in December, they had proceeded without
accident thus far, when a large body of Comanches and Kiowas were seen advancing
towards them. Being well acquainted with the treacherous and pusillanimous disposition
of these races, the traders prepared at once for defence; but the savages,
having made a halt at some distance, began to approach, one by one or in small parties,
making a great show of friendship all the while, until most of them had collected
on the spot. Finding themselves surrounded in every direction, the travelers
now began to move on in hopes of getting rid of the intruders, but the latter were
equally ready for the start, and mounting their horses kept jogging on in the same
direction. The first act of hostility perpetrated by the Indians proved fatal to one
of the American traders named Pratt, who was shot dead while attempting to secure
two mules which had become separated from the rest. Upon this the companions
of the slain man immediately dismounted and commenced a fire upon the Indians,
which was warmly returned, whereby another man of the name of Mitchell was
killed. By this time the traders had taken off their packs and piled them around
for protection, and now falling to work with their hands they very soon scratched
out a trench deep enough to protect them from the shot of the enemy. The latter
made several desperate charges, but they seemed too careful of their own personal
safety, notwithstanding the enormous superiority of their numbers, to venture too
near the rifles of the Americans. In a few hours all the animals of the traders were
either killed or wounded, but no personal damage was done to the remaining ten
men, with the exception of a wound in the thigh received by one, which was not at
the time considered dangerous.</p>

<p>During the siege the Americans were in great danger of perishing from thirst, as
the Indians had complete command of all the water within reach. Starvation was
not so much to be dreaded, because in case of necessity they could live on the flesh of
their slain animals, some of which lay stretched close around them. After being
pent up for thirty-six hours in this horrible hole, during which time they had seldom,
ventured to raise their heads above the surface without being shot at, they resolved
to make a bold sortie in the night, as any death was preferable to the death which
awaited them there. As there was not an animal left that was at all in a condition,
to travel, the proprietors of the money gave permission to all to take and appropriate
to themselves whatever amount each man could safely undertake to carry. In
this way a few hundred dollars were started with, of which, however, but little
ever reached the United States. The remainder was buried deep in the sand, in
hopes that it might escape the cupidity of the savages, but to very little purpose,
for they were afterward seen by some Mexican traders making a great display of
specie, which was without doubt taken from this unfortunate cache.</p>

<p>With every prospect of being discovered, overtaken, and butchered, but resolved
to sell their lives as dearly as possible, they at last emerged from their hiding place
and moved on silently and slowly until they found themselves beyond the purlieus
of the Indian camps. Often did they look back in the direction where from three
to five hundred savages were supposed to watch their movements, but much to their
astonishment no one appeared to be in pursuit. The Indians, believing, no doubt,
that the property of the traders would come into their hands, and having no amateur
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
predilection for taking scalps at the risk of losing their own, appeared willing
enough to let the spoliated adventurers depart without further molestation.</p>

<p>The destitute travelers having run themselves short of provisions, and being no
longer able to kill game for want of materials to load their rifles with, they were
very soon reduced to the necessity of sustaining life upon the roots and the tender
bark of trees. After traveling for several days in this desperate condition, with
lacerated feet and utter prostration of mind and body, they began to disagree among
themselves about the route to be pursued, and eventually separated into two distinct
parties. Five of these unhappy men steered a westward (<i>sic</i>) course, and after a
succession of sufferings and privations which almost surpassed belief, they reached
the settlements of the Creek Indians, near the Arkansas river, where they were
treated with great kindness and hospitality. The other five wandered about in the
greatest state of distress and bewilderment, and only two finally succeeded in getting
out of the mazes of the wilderness. Among those who were abandoned to their
fate and left to perish thus miserably, was a Mr Schenck, the same individual who
had been shot in the thigh, a gentleman of talent and excellent family connections,
who was a brother, as I am informed, of the Honorable Mr Schenck, at present a
member of congress from Ohio (<cite>Gregg, 2</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Kiowa had undoubtedly attacked the traders, believing them to
be their enemies the Texans, instead of Americans, as the place was
outside of what were then the limits of the United States, and over a
hundred miles from the trail usually traveled by the American traders
to Santa Fé. This is apparent from Gregg's experience in 1839 in
nearly the same place. While proceeding up the Canadian with an
escort of dragoons they fell in with a large party of Comanche, and
after a doubtful preliminary talk, in which the Comanche very pointedly
refused to smoke the proffered pipe, the officer began to speak of
the advantages of peace and friendship, and invited some of their
headmen to visit the great chief at Washington and make a treaty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But they would not then converse on the subject. In fact, the interpreter inquired,
"Are we not at war? How, then, can we go to see the <i>Capitan Grande</i>?" We knew
they believed themselves at war with Mexico and Texas, and probably had mistaken
us for Texans.... Upon this we explained to them that the United States was a
distinct government and at peace with the Comanche. On this explanation the
chiefs said they were glad to see Americans in their country and hoped more of
them would come (<cite>Gregg, 3</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="d1833">SUMMER 1833</h3>

<p><i>Ĭmk`ódaltä-dé Pai</i>, "Summer that they cut off their heads." This
picture commemorates one of the most vivid memories of the older
men of the tribe&mdash;a wholesale massacre by the Osage, who cut off the
heads of their victims and deposited them in buckets upon the scene
of the slaughter. Set-t'an, the author of the calendar, was born in
this summer. The picture of a severed head with bloody neck and a
bloody knife underneath is sufficiently suggestive. The absence of
the usual figure of the sun-dance lodge shows that no dance was held
this summer, owing to the fact that the Osage captured the <i>taime</i>
medicine at the same time. The massacre occurred just west of a
mountain called by the Kiowa <i>K`ódaltä K`op</i>, "Beheading mountain,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
on the headwaters of Otter creek, not 2 miles northwest from Saddle
mountain and about 25 miles northwest from Fort Sill.</p>

<p>It was in early spring and the Kiowa were camped at the mouth of
Rainy-mountain creek, a southern tributary of the Washita, within the
present limits of the reservation; nearly all the warriors had gone
against the Ute, so that few, excepting women, children, and old men,
were at home. One morning some young men going out to look for
horses discovered signs of Osage and immediately gave the alarm.
According to one story, they found a buffalo with an Osage arrow sticking
in it; according to T'ébodal and other old men, they came upon the
Osage themselves and exchanged shots, wounding an Osage, but with
the loss of one of their own men killed. On the alarm being given,
the Kiowa at once broke camp in a panic and fled in four parties in
different directions&mdash;one party toward the west, another toward the
east, and two other bands, among whom was T'ébodal, then a boy,
went directly south toward the Comanche. Three of these escaped,
but the fourth, under A`dáte, "Island-man," thinking the pursuit was
over, stopped on a small tributary of Otter creek, just
west of the mountain.</p>

<div class="figleft w25" id="fig63">

alt="" /></a>
<p class="hang2"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 63&mdash;Summer 1833&mdash;They cut off their heads.</p>
</div>

<p>Early in the morning, almost before it was yet light, a
young man (whose grandson was present during T'ébodal's
narration) went to look for his ponies, when he saw the
Osage creeping up on foot. He hastily ran back with the
news, but all the camp was still sleeping, except the wife
A`dáte, who was outside preparing to scrape a
hide. Entering the tipi, he roused the chief, who ran out
shouting to his people, "<i>Tsó bätsó! Tsó bätsó!</i>"&mdash;To the rocks! To
the rocks! Thus rudely awakened, the Kiowa sprang up and fled to
the mountain, the mothers seizing their children and the old men hurrying
as best they could, with their bloodthirsty enemies close behind.
The chief himself was pursued and slightly wounded, but got away;
his wife, Sémätmä, "Apache-woman," was taken, but soon afterward
made her escape. One woman fled with a baby girl on her back and
dragging a larger girl by the hand; an Osage pursuing caught the
older girl and was drawing his knife across her throat when the
mother rushed to her aid and succeeded in beating him off and rescued
the child with only a slight gash upon her head. A boy named Äyä,
"Sitting-on-a-tree" (?), was saved by his father in about the same way,
and is still alive, an old man, to tell it. His father, it is said, seized
and held him in his teeth, putting him down while shooting arrows to
keep off the pursuers, and taking him up again to run. A party of
women was saved by a brave Pawnee living in the camp, who succeeded
in fighting off the pursuers long enough to enable the women to reach
a place of safety.</p>

<p>The warriors-being absent, the Kiowa made no attempt at a stand;
it was simply a surprise and flight of panic-stricken, women, children,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
and old men, in which everyone caught was butchered on the spot.
Two children were taken prisoners, a brother and sister&mdash;about 10 and
12 years of age, respectively&mdash;of whom more hereafter. The Kiowa lost
five men killed and a large number of women and children; none of the
Osage were killed, as no fight was made. When the massacre was
ended, the enemy cut the heads from all the dead bodies, without scalping
them, and placed them in brass buckets, one head in each bucket,
all over the camp ground, after which they set fire to the tipis and left
the place. When the scattered Kiowa returned to look for their friends,
they found the camp destroyed, the decapitated bodies lying where they
had fallen, and the heads in the buckets as the Osage had left them.
The buckets had been obtained by the Kiowa from the Pawnee, who
procured them on the Missouri and traded them to the southern tribes.
For allowing the camp to be thus surprised the chief, A`dáte, was deposed,
and was superseded by Dohá, or Doháte, "Bluff," better known
as Dohásän, who thenceforth ruled the tribe until his death, thirty-three
years later.</p>

<p>Among the victims of the massacre was a Kiowa chief who had been
present the previous winter at the attack on the American traders.
His friends buried with him a quantity of silver dollars which had
formed his share of the spoil on that occasion. An old woman, the last
remaining person who knew the place of sepulture, died a few years ago.</p>

<p>In this affair the Osage also captured the <i>taíme</i> medicine, already
described, killing the wife of the <i>taíme</i> keeper as she was trying to
unfasten it from the tipi pole to which it was tied; her husband, Ansó te,
escaped. In consequence of this loss, there was no sun dance
for two years, when, peace having been made between the two tribes,
as will be related farther on, the Kiowa visited the Osage camp, somewhere
on the Cimarron or the Salt fork of the Arkansas, and recovered
it, afterward giving a horse in return for it. Dohásän, who conducted
the negotiations, asked the Osage about it and offered a pinto pony and
several other ponies for it. The Osage said that they had it, and went
home and brought it, but in token of their friendship refused to accept
more than a single pony in return. On this occasion both <i>taíme</i> images
were captured, together with the case in which they were kept.</p>

<p>Two points in connection with this massacre deserve attention.
First, the Osage war party was on foot; this, as the Kiowa state, was
the general custom of the Osage and Pawnee, more especially the latter,
who are sometimes called <i>Domáñk`íägo</i>, "Walkers," by the Kiowa,
and was occasionally followed by other tribes, including also the
Kiowa. Grinnell states that the Blackfeet always went to war on foot
(<cite>Grinnell, Blackfeet, 2</cite>). There was an obvious advantage in the practice,
as a foot party could more easily travel and approach a hostile
camp without attracting observation, relying on themselves to procure
horses to enable them to return mounted. T'ébodal, when a young
man, was twice a member of a large Kiowa war party which went out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
on foot. The Kiowa say that the Pawnee in particular went afoot on
war expeditions, and more recently when they visited other tribes for
the purpose of a social dance, in the latter case always returning with
large numbers of ponies given them by their entertainers (see summer
<a href="#d1851">1851</a> and winter <a href="#d1871_72">1871&mdash;72</a>). Gregg says that small war parties of
the Pawnee were accustomed to rove on foot through every part of the
plains, even to the Mexican frontier, but generally returning mounted
on captured horses. When, on one occasion, his train was attacked
upon the upper Canadian, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was evidently a foot party, which we looked upon as another proof of their
being Pawnees, for these famous marauders are well known to go forth upon their
expeditious of plunder without horses, although they seldom fail to return well
mounted (<cite>Gregg, 4</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Dunbar says that Pawnee runners have been known repeatedly to
travel over 100 miles in twenty-four hours or less, going at a swinging
trot, without stopping on the way for sleep or food (<cite>Clark, 11</cite>).</p>

<p>Secondly, it is to be noted that the Osage beheaded the Kiowa without
scalping them. This, the Kiowa say, was a general Osage practice;
in fact, according to the Kiowa, the Osage never scalped their enemies,
but cut off the heads and left them unscalped upon the field. They
kept tally of the number killed, however, and when an Osage warrior
had killed four he painted a blue half circle, curving downward, upon
his breast. So far as Kiowa knowledge goes, no other tribe of the
plains practiced the custom of beheading, but all of them scalped their
enemies. It seems certain, however, that the Dakota at an early period
had the same custom, as they are called "Beheaders" in several Indian
languages, while their name is indicated in the sign language by drawing
the hand across the throat to signify the same thing. Clark says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In former times the Sioux Indians, if they had time, cut off the heads of their
slain enemies and took them to their first camp after the fight, where the entire
scalp was taken off. To make it particularly fine, they kept on the ears with the
rings and ornaments. In case a woman had lost some of her kin by death, and her
heart was, as they say, <i>bad</i>, she was at times allowed to go with the war party,
remaining in the camp established near the point of attack. The head of a slain
foe would be given to her, and after removing the scalp she would make her heart
<i>good</i> by smashing the skull with a war club (<cite>Clark, 12</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Among other tribes, as well as the Osage, especially in the north, the
number of enemies slain or other brave deeds performed was sometimes
indicated by the style of body paint or dress adornment. Among
the Kiowa the number of transverse stripes upon a woman's legging
indicates the scalps or <i>coups</i> won by some warrior kinsman.</p>

<h3 id="d1833_34">WINTER 1833&mdash;34</h3>

<p><i>D'ä´-p'é'gyä-de Sai</i>, "Winter that the stars fell." This winter takes
its name from the memorable meteoric display which occurred shortly
before daylight on the morning of November 13, 1833. It was observed
throughout North America, and created great excitement among the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
plains tribes, as well as among a large part of our own population;
the event is still used as a chronologic starting point by
the old people of the various tribes. It is pictorially
represented on most of the Dakota calendars discussed
by Mallery in his valuable work on the Picture Writing
of the American Indians. Set-t'an was born in the preceding

<p>The Kiowa say it occurred in the winter season, when
they were camped on a small tributary of Elm fork of
Red river, within the present Greer county, Oklahoma.
The whole camp was asleep, when they were wakened by
a sudden light; running out from the tipis, they found
the night as bright as day, with myriads of meteors darting
about in the sky. The parents aroused the children,
saying, "Get up, get up, there is something awful
(<i>zédălbe</i>) going on!" They had never before known such
an occurrence, and regarded it as something ominous or dangerous,
and sat watching it with dread and apprehension
until daylight. Such phenomena are
always looked upon as omens or warnings by
the ignorant; in Mexico, according to Gregg,
it was believed to be a sign of divine displeasure
at a sacrilegious congress which had
recently curtailed the privileges of the church,
while in Missouri it was regarded by some as a
protest from heaven against the persecution of
the Mormons then gathered near Independence
(<cite>Gregg, 5</cite>).</p>

</div>

<p>As the return of this girl was the object of the first
American expedition up Red river, and the beginning
of our official and trading relations with the Comanche,
Kiowa, Wichita, and affiliated tribes, it merits somewhat extended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
notice. The expedition and subsequent council are noted in the report
of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for 1834 (page 240), and are
described at length in the journal of Lieutenant Wheelock (<cite>Greer, 1</cite>),
and in the letters of the artist Catlin, who accompanied the party and
painted the first pictures ever made of any of these tribes. The resulting
treaties of 1835 and 1837 are noted in the Commissioner's reports
for these years (<cite>Report, 74</cite>). The first Indian story of the occurrence is
here given:</p>

<p>After the massacre at <i>K`ódaltä K`op</i>, already described, the Osage
returned to their own country, where there was a soldier camp (i. e., Fort
Gibson), bringing with them the Kiowa girl Gunpä´ñdamä (Medicine-tied-to-tipi-pole)
and her brother, taken at the time of the massacre.
The woman captured at the same time had escaped and made her way
back to her people. At Fort Gibson the soldiers told the Osage that
as they and other Kiowa were all alike Indians they should be friends.
They then bought the two captive children from the Osage and proposed
that some of the Osage should return with them (the soldiers) to
the Kiowa country, there to give back the children to their friends and
invite the Kiowa to come down to the fort and make a permanent treaty
of peace and friendship between the two tribes. The Osage agreed,
and accordingly a large party of soldiers, accompanied by a number of
Osage, with the girl Gunpä´ñdamä, set out for the Kiowa country. The
little boy had been killed by a sheep before starting. With them went
also the famous trader, Colonel Auguste Chouteau, called "Soto" by the
Kiowa, the first American trader known to the Kiowa, Wichita, and associated
tribes. Up to this time the Kiowa had been at war with the Osage
and had no knowledge of our government, and these dragoons were the
first United States troops they had ever seen. The soldiers first met
the Comanche, who told them that the Kiowa were near the Wichita
village at the farther end of the mountains. When the troops arrived
at the village, the Kiowa were afraid and kept at a distance until they
saw the girl, which convinced them that the soldiers were their friends.
The girl was given back to her people, and at the request of the soldiers
a number of Kiowa, including the head chief, Doháte, returned with
them and the Osage to the camp at Fort Gibson. They do not remember
whether any of the Apache went. There the soldiers entertained
the Kiowa with food, coffee, and sugar, and gave them blankets and
other presents. A treaty of peace was made between the Kiowa
and soldiers (i. e., Americans), and the Osage and other Kiowa were
invited to trade with Chouteau, who promised to bring goods to their
country. Since that time the two tribes have been friends. Hitherto
the Kiowa had never had any traders in their country, but after this
peace a regular trade was established. The first trader, whom they
call Tóme or Tóme-te (Thomas?) came soon afterward and built a
trading post on the west side of Cache creek, about 3 miles below the
present Fort Sill; but he did not stay long.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p>Dohá, Doháte, or Dohásän (Bluff or Little-bluff), the head of the
tribe at the time of this expedition, had superseded A`dáte, who had
been deposed as a punishment for having allowed his people to be surprised
and massacred by the Osage. In his youth Dóha had been,
known, as Äanóñte. He was the fourth head chief of the tribe from
the time of the treaty with the Comanche, the order of succession
being Políăkya (Harelip), alias Kágiätsé (Thick-blanket); Tsóñbohón
(Feather-cap), A`dáte, and Dohásän. He continued to be recognized
as head chief until his death in 1866. The name is hereditary in the
family, which is one of the most prominent in the tribe, and has been
borne by this chief&mdash;distinguished as Old Dohásän&mdash;by his nephew,
who died at an advanced age at Anadarko in the winter of 1893&mdash;94, and
by his son. The older men state that the father of the great Dohásän
was also called Dohá, and that his son, after assuming the same name,
was known as Dohásän, (Little-bluff) for distinction. He is spoken of
as Doháte as frequently as Dohásän.</p>

<p>According to one informant, at the time of the Osage massacre
Chouteau had a trading post about a day's journey east of the present
Fort Sill, and the Kiowa went to him and told him of their misfortune,
whereupon he went to Fort Gibson and induced the soldiers to rescue
the captives from the Osage and return them to their friends. This is
perhaps a confusion of events. The trading post referred to was at
Chouteau spring, on the east side of Chouteau creek which flows into
the South Canadian from the east, about 5 miles northeast of the present
town of Purcell, Indian Territory. It does not appear, however, to
have been established until after, and as a result of, this expedition.</p>

<p>The expedition is described in detail by the artist Catlin, who accompanied
it and was present at the council on its return. As the Comanche,
Kiowa, and Wichita lived so remote from the frontiers, they had
not yet been brought into official connection with the United States,
and consequently had several times, as we have seen, come into collision
with small parties of Americans on the borders of their country.
The government had for some time been desirous of entering into treaty
relations with them, more especially as the plan of colonizing the eastern
tribes in the western country had been put into operation. As the
Osage, who were already in treaty relations with the government, had
several captives taken from the more western tribes, it was decided to
purchase these prisoners and send them home under military escort as
a token of the friendly intentions of the government, with an invitation
to the chiefs of those tribes to come to the military post and make a
treaty with the United States, the Osage, and the immigrant tribes.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the two Kiowa children and two Wichita children, captives,
were purchased from the Osage and brought to Fort Gibson;
unfortunately, the little Kiowa boy was killed near the post shortly after
by a blow from a ram. An expedition of the First dragoons was organized,
under command of General Leavenworth, to restore the children to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
their parents and open communication with their tribes. The troops,
numbering about four hundred, left Fort Gibson toward the end of June,
1834, taking with them the three children and accompanied by about
thirty of the Osage, Cherokee, Delaware, and Seneca tribes, together
with the artist Catlin, and, according to the Indian account, Chouteau
and perhaps another trader. Their interpreter was a Cherokee with a
"very imperfect" knowledge of Spanish, through which language he
hoped to open communication with Spanish-speaking Indians among the
tribes visited; his ignorance probably accounts for the atrocious names
and etymologies given by Catlin. The march in the heat of summer
proved so severe that by the time the command reached the junction of
Washita and Red rivers about one third of the number, including the commanding
general, were prostrated; the remainder, constantly dwindling,
pushed on in charge of Colonel Henry Dodge, keeping a general northwest
course along the divide between the two streams. They were considered
to be within the Comanche country after crossing the Washita.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 67&mdash;Meeting of the dragoons and the Comanche (after Catlin).</p>
</div>

<p>Having traveled about two weeks, they one day discovered a large
party of Comanche several miles ahead, sitting quietly on their horses
watching the movements of the advancing troops, and holding, their long
lances in their hands, the blades glistening in the sun. As the cavalry
advanced toward them the Indians retreated to another ridge. This
was repeated several times, until at last, says Catlin&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Colonel Dodge ordered the command to halt, while he rode forward with a few of
his staff and an ensign carrying a white flag. I joined this advance, and the Indians
stood their ground until we had come within half a mile of them and could distinctly
observe all their numbers and movements. We then came to a halt, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
white flag was sent a little in advance and waved as a signal for them to approach,
at which one of their party galloped out in advance of the war party on a milk-white
horse, carrying a piece of white buffalo skin on the point of his long lance in
reply to our flag.... The distance between the two parties was perhaps half a
mile, and that a beautiful and gently sloping prairie, over which he was for the
space of a quarter of an hour reining and spurring his maddened horse and gradually
approaching us by tacking to the right and left like a vessel beating against
the wind. He at length came prancing and leaping along till he met the flag of the
regiment, when he leaned his spear for a moment against it, looking the bearer full
in the face, when he wheeled his horse and dashed up to Colonel Dodge with his
extended hand, which was instantly grasped and shaken. We all had him by the
hand in a moment, and the rest of the party seeing him received in this friendly
manner, instead of being sacrificed, as they undoubtedly expected, started under
full whip in a direct line toward us, and in a moment gathered like a black cloud
around us.... The warrior's quiver was slung on the warrior's back, and his bow
grasped in his left hand ready for instant use if called for. His shield was on his
arm; and across his thigh, in a beautiful cover of buckskin, his gun was slung, and
in his right hand his lance of fourteen feet in length. Thus armed and equipped
was this dashing cavalier, and nearly in the same manner all the rest of the party
(<cite>Catlin, 4</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>When the purpose of the expedition had been explained to them, the
Comanche said that their great village was a few days farther ahead,
and abandoning their war expedition, they turned and escorted the
troops to their camp. According to statements made by old men of
the tribe to Horace P. Jones, post interpreter at Fort Sill, this Comanche
village in 1834 was situated on Chandler creek, close to its junction
with Cache creek, about ten miles north of the present Fort Sill. The
artist gives a glowing account of the surrounding country and of their
reception by the Comanche.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Having led us to the top of a gently rising elevation on the prairie, they pointed
to their village at several miles distance, in the midst of one of the most enchanting
valleys that human eyes ever looked upon. The general course of the valley is
from northwest to southeast, of several miles in width, with a magnificent range of
mountains rising in distance beyond, it being without doubt a huge spur of the
Rocky mountains, composed entirely of a reddish granite or gneiss, corresponding
with the other links of this stupendous chain. In the midst of this lovely valley
we could just discern amongst the scattering shrubbery that lined the banks of the
water courses, the tops of the Comanche wigwams and the smoke curling above
them. The valley for a mile distant about the village seemed speckled with horses
and mules that were grazing in it. The chiefs of the war party requested the regiment
to halt until they could ride in and inform their people who were coming.
We then dismounted for an hour or so, when we could see them, busily running and
catching their horses, and at length several hundreds of their braves and warriors
came out at full speed to welcome us, and forming in a line in front of us, as we
were again mounted, presented a formidable and pleasing appearance. As they
wheeled their horses, they very rapidly formed in a line and dressed like well-disciplined
cavalry. The regiment was drawn up in three columns, with a line
formed in front, by Colonel Dodge and his staff, in which rank my friend Chadwick
and I were also paraded, when we had a fine view of the whole man&oelig;uvre, which
was picturesque and thrilling in the extreme.</p>

<p>In the center of our advance was stationed a white flag, and the Indians answered
to it with one which they sent forward and planted by the side of it. The two lines
were thus drawn up face to face within 20 or 30 yards of each other, as inveterate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
foes that never had met; and to the everlasting credit of the Comanches, whom the
world had always looked upon as murderous and hostile, they had all come out in
this manner, with their heads uncovered, and without a weapon of any kind, to
meet a war party bristling with arms and trespassing to the middle of their country.
They had every reason to look upon us as their natural enemy, as they have been in
the habit of estimating all pale faces; and yet instead of arms or defences, or even
of frowns, they galloped out and looked us in our faces, without an expression of
fear or dismay, and evidently with expressions of joy and impatient pleasure, to
shake us by the hand, on the bare assertion of Colonel Dodge, which had been made
to the chiefs, that we came to see them on a friendly visit.</p>

<p>After we had sat and gazed at each other in this way for some half an hour or so,
the head chief of the band came galloping up to Colonel Dodge, and having shaken
him by the hand, he passed on to the other officers in turn and then rode alongside
of the different columns, shaking hands with every dragoon in the regiment; he
was followed in this by his principal chiefs and braves, which altogether took up
nearly an hour longer, when the Indians retreated slowly toward their village,
escorting us to the banks of a fine, clear stream and a good spring of fresh water,
half a mile from their village, which they designated as a suitable place for our
encampment (<cite>Catlin, 5</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>While there the artist painted the pictures of the chief men of the
tribe, together with camp scenes. The pictures form a part of the
Catlin gallery in the National Museum at Washington, District of
Columbia. In his usual incorrect style, he estimated the population
of the tribe at thirty thousand to forty thousand. It may possibly
have been one-tenth of that number.</p>

<p>After a few days the command, guided by some of the Comanche,
started for the Wichita village lying farther to the west. After four
days' march, keeping close along the base of the mountains, they reached
the village, which was situated on the northeast bank of the North
fork of Red river, about 4 miles below the junction of Elm fork, and
within the present limits of the reservation. It was close to the mouth
of Devil canyon, with the river in front and the mountains behind.
It was an old settlement site of the Wichita, having been occupied by
them as far back at least as about the year 1765 (<cite>Lewis and Clark, 8</cite>).
Catlin thus describes it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We found the mountains inclosing the Pawnee [i.e., Pawnee Pique, or Wichita]
village, on the bank of Red river, about 90 miles from the Comanchee town. The
dragoon regiment was drawn up within half a mile or so of this village and encamped
in a square, where we remained three days. We found here a very numerous village
containing some five or six hundred wigwams, all made of long prairie grass thatched
over poles which are fastened in the ground and bent in at the top, giving to them
in distance the appearance of straw beehives, as in plate 173 [<a href="#fig68">figure 68</a> herein], which
is an accurate view of it, showing the Red river in front and the "mountains of
rocks" behind it. To our very great surprise we have found these people cultivating
quite extensive fields of corn (maize), pumpkins, melons, beans, and squashes; so,
with these aids and an abundant supply of buffalo meat, they may be said to be
living very well (<cite>Catlin, 6</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The picture by Catlin gives a good idea of the location and a tolerable
idea of the peculiar conical grass houses of the Wichita, who have
always been noted as an agricultural tribe. As usual, however, he has
grossly overestimated their number, attributing to the village five or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
six hundred houses, and to the Wichita and Kiowa eight to ten thousand
population. It is very doubtful if the two tribes, with all their
affiliated bands, ever numbered a total of twenty-five hundred. The
Wichita village may have had, all told, seventy or eighty houses. When
the author examined the ground, in 1893, the circular depressions where
the houses had stood were still regular in shape and plainly visible.
According to Wichita information, the village was called Kĭ´tskûkătû´k,
a name which seems to refer to its situation beside the mountain, and
was abandoned soon after 1834, when the tribe removed to a new location,
where Fort Sill is now located. From there they again removed
to Rush spring, about 25 miles farther east, where Marcy found them
in 1852. The mountains immediately about the site of the village
visited by the dragoons are still known to the Kiowa as <i>Do`gúat
K`op</i>, "Wichita mountains," the name not being applied by them to
the more eastern portion of the range.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75" id="fig68">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 68&mdash;Kĭ´tskûkătû´k, the Wichita village on Northfork in 1834 (after Catlin).</p>
</div>

<p>The meeting with the Wichita threatened at the start to be hostile.
Having learned that they had in their possession a captive white boy,
Colonel Dodge demanded that he be surrendered. They repeatedly
denied having any knowledge of the boy or the circumstances attending
his capture until, being convinced by the sight of their own children
brought back by the dragoons that the intentions of the white
visitors were friendly, they produced him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An order was immediately given for the Pawnee and Kiowa girls to be brought
forward. They were in a few minutes brought into the council house, when they
were at once recognized by their friends and relatives, who embraced them with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
most extravagant expressions of joy and satisfaction. The heart of the venerable
chief was melted at this evidence of the white man's friendship, and he rose upon
his feet, and taking Colonel Dodge in his arms and, placing his left cheek against
the left cheek of the colonel, held him for some minutes without saying a word,
whilst tears were flowing from his eyes. He then embraced each officer in turn in
the same silent and affectionate manner, which form took half an hour or more
before it was completed.</p>

<p>From this moment the council, which before had been a very grave and uncertain
one, took a pleasing and friendly turn, and this excellent old man ordered the women
to supply the dragoons with something to eat, as they were hungry. The little
encampment, which heretofore was in a woeful condition, having eaten up their last
rations twelve hours before, were now gladdened by the approach of a number of
women who brought their "back loads" of dried buffalo meat and green corn, and
threw it down amongst them. This seemed almost like a providential deliverance,
for the country between here and the Comanchees was entirely destitute of game
and our last provisions were consumed.</p>

<p>The council thus proceeded successfully and pleasantly for several days, whilst
the warriors of the Kiowas and Wicos [Wacos], two adjoining and friendly tribes
living farther to the west, were arriving, and also a great many from other bands
of the Comanchees, who had heard of our arrival, until two thousand or more of
these wild and fearless-looking fellows were assembled, and all, from their horses'
backs, with weapons in hand, were looking into our pitiful little encampment of two
hundred men, all in a state of dependence and almost literal starvation, and at the
same time nearly one-half the number too sick to have made a successful resistance
if we were to have been attacked (<cite>Catlin, 7</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The result of the council was that a large delegation from the allied
tribes returned with the troops to Fort Gibson, where arrangements
were made for the subsequent treaties of 1835 and 1837, as already
described, which mark the beginning of the modern history of the
Kiowa, Comanche, Wichita, and affiliated bands.</p>

<p>The Wichita, as well as the Kiowa, still remember this friendly meeting.
Nasthoe, a Wichita chief, in giving testimony in 1894 in regard to
the location of the old village, said: "I was told that the white people
and the Osage and the Kidi-ki-tashe [Wichita] came to that old village,
where they lived and brought that girl and boy, and inside of one of
those tipis they had made a feast among themselves, and the soldiers
had fired their guns around there. The meaning of that was a peace"
(<cite>Greer County, 1</cite>).</p>

<p>While with this expedition Catlin painted a number of portraits,
the first on record from these tribes. He has this to say of his Kiowa
subjects:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The head chief of the Kioways, whose name is Teh-toot-sah [Dohásän, see page <a href="#Page_175">175</a>],
we found to be a very gentlemanly and high-minded man, who treated the dragoons
and officers with great kindness while in his country. His long hair, which was put
up in several large clubs and ornamented with a great many silver brooches, extended
quite down to his knees. This distinguished man, as well as several others of his
tribe, have agreed to join us on the march to Fort Gibson, so I shall have much of
their company yet, and probably much more to say of them at a future period. Bon-son-gee
(The New Fire) [Bohón-kóñkya, Black-cap], is another chief of this tribe,
and called a very good man; the principal ornaments which he carried on his person
were a boar's tusk and his war whistle, which were hanging on his breast. Quay-ham-kay
(The Stone Shell) is another fair specimen of the warriors of this tribe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
... Wun-pan-to-mee (The White Weasel) [Gunpü´ñdamä´, Medicine-tied-to-tipi-pole],
a girl, and Tunk-aht-oh-ye (The Thunderer), a boy, who are brother and sister,
are two Kioways who were purchased from the Osages, to be taken to their tribe by
the dragoons. The girl was taken the whole distance with us, on horseback, to the
Pawnee village, and there delivered to her friends, as I have before
mentioned; and the fine little boy was killed at the fur trader's house,
on the banks of the Verdigris, near Fort Gibson, the day after I
painted his portrait, and only a few days before he was to have
started with us on the march. He was a beautiful boy of nine or ten
years of age, and was killed by a ram, which struck him in the abdomen,
and knocking him against a fence, killed him instantly. Kots-a-to-ah
(The Smoked Shield) is another of the extraordinary men of
this tribe, near 7 feet in stature, and distinguished not only as one
of the greatest warriors, but the swiftest on foot in the nation. This
man, it is said, runs down a buffalo on foot, and slays it with his knife
or his lance as he runs by its side! (<cite>Catlin, 8</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Kiowa had made their winter camp on the Washita, when a war
party set out against the <i>Toñhéñ-t'a`ká-i</i> (Mexicans of
the waterless country), or Chihuahuans. Having
started late, they camped all winter at a mountain
toward the southern edge of the Staked plain, known
as <i>Déngyä-kóñ K`op</i>, or "Black-ice mountain." One
morning in the early spring, while several men were
out looking for their ponies, they were suddenly surrounded
by the Mexicans and all killed, including
Pa-ton, who was shot through the body. Their comrades
saw the fight from a distance, but, being outnumbered
and therefore afraid to come near to help
them, they got away as soon as they could.</p>

<p><i>Donpä K`ádó</i>, "Cat-tail rush sun dance." This was
the first sun dance held by the Kiowa after the recovery
of the <i>taíme</i> from the Osages, already narrated, and is
thus distinguished because it was held at a place where a great many
cat-tail rushes (<i>Equisetum arvense</i>) were growing on the south bank of
North Canadian river, at the Red hills, about 30 miles above the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
present Fort Reno, Oklahoma. The soft white portion of the lower
part of the stalk of this rush is eaten raw by the Indians with great
relish. The picture above the medicine lodge represents the <i>taíme</i>
<i>bíĭmkâ-í</i> or rawhide box in which the <i>taíme</i> is kept.</p>

<p>It was immediately after this dance that a war party of Kiowa made
the raid far down toward the coast in which they captured Bóiñ-edal
(Big-blond), now the oldest captive in the tribe. This man, sometimes
known to the whites as Kiowa Dutch, was born in Germany and is now,
according to his own account, about 70 years of age. He remembers
having gone to school in Germany as a small boy, and came to this
country, when about 8 or 9 years of age, with his father, stepmother, and
an elder brother. He describes the place where they located as being
a small settlement on a large river, up which ships could sail, where
there were alligators and trees with long moss, and which was within
a day's ride of the sea. The people were engaged in raising cotton, his
family being the only Germans. From other evidence it
seems to have been about Matagorda or Galveston bay,
showing that the Kiowa carried their raids in this direction
even to the coast. Within a year of their coming,
and before he had learned English, a Kiowa war party
attacked the settlement at night, carried off himself, his
mother, and his brother, and probably killed his father;
his mother was taken in another direction and he never
saw her again; she was afterward ransomed by Tométe,
the trader already mentioned; his brother committed suicide
during the cholera epidemic of 1849; Bóiñ-edal is still
with the tribe. As his name indicates, he is a typical German
in appearance, and still remembers a few words of his
mother language, besides having a fair knowledge of English
and Spanish, although he does not remember his own
name or birthplace. It was about the same time that the
Comanche raided Barker's fort, on the Navasota, in eastern
Texas, and carried off the girl Cynthia Parker, who afterward
became the mother of Quanah, the present chief of the tribe. The story
of these captives may have a hundred parallels among the three confederated
tribes.</p>

teeth for ornamenting their buckskin shirts and
the dresses of the women. After they had gone,
those who remained behind were attacked in their

threw up breastworks and defended
themselves until their assailants were
compelled to retire.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
from the present Port Elliott in the panhandle of Texas. It was in
early summer, and they were preparing for the sun dance; a young
man was out alone straightening arrows when he saw two men creeping
up, with grass over their faces. Thinking they were Kiowa deer
hunters, he advanced to meet them, when they fired and wounded him
and his horse; he fled back to camp and gave the alarm, and Kiowa,
Comanche, and Apache rushed out in pursuit. They soon came up
with a small party of the enemy, who proved to be Cheyenne. The
Kiowa and their allies killed three of them there, and following the
fugitives killed several others; continuing along the trail down the
north side of the creek to a short distance below its junction with
Sweetwater, they came upon the main camp of the Cheyenne, who dug
holes in the sand and made a good defense, but were at last all killed
except one, who strangled himself with a rope to avoid capture. The
bodies of the dead Cheyenne, 48 in number, were scalped, stripped, and
laid along the ground in a row by the victors. Six Kiowa were killed,
including the grandfather of the present Lone-wolf. T'ébodal, the

carried by those who were pledged to die at their post. The stream

<p>Three Comanche, two men and a woman, were camped alone one
night in a tipi on the Clear fork of the Brazos (<i>Ä´sese P'a</i>, "Wooden-arrowpoint

raise the door-flap and then quickly drop it again; he told the others,
and as silently and swiftly as possible they ran out, and jumping over
a steep bank of the creek hid themselves just a moment before their
enemies returned and fired into the vacated tipi.
The Comanche returned the fire from their hiding
place and then made their escape to a Kiowa camp
near by. In the morning the Kiowa returned to the
spot, together with the Comanche, and found a dead
Arapaho lying where he had been shot; they scalped
and beheaded him, and brought the head into camp
dragging at the end of a reata. The old German
captive, Bóiñ-edal, then a little boy and who had been

<p>This was the great smallpox epidemic which began on the upper
Missouri in the summer of 1837 and swept the whole plains north and
south, destroying probably a third, if not more, of the native
inhabitants, some whole tribes being nearly exterminated. The
terribly fatal result of smallpox among Indians is due largely to the
fact that their only treatment for this disease and for measles, both
of which came to them from the whites, is the sweat bath followed by
the cold plunge. In this instance the disease first broke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
out among the passengers of a steamer in the Missouri river above
Fort Leavenworth, and although every effort was made to warn the
Indians by sending runners in advance, the sickness was communicated
to them. It appeared first among the Mandan about the middle of July,
1837, and practically destroyed that tribe, reducing them in a few
weeks from about sixteen hundred to thirty-one souls. Their
neighboring and allied tribes, the Arikara and Minitarí, were reduced
immediately after from about four thousand to about half that number.
The artist Catlin gives a melancholy account of the despair and
destruction of the Mandan.</p>

<p>From the Mandan it spread
to the north and west among
the Crows, Asiniboin, and
Blackfeet. Among the last
named it is estimated to have destroyed from six to eight thousand
(<cite>Clark, 13</cite>). As the plains tribes were then almost unknown to the
general government, we find little of all this in the official reports
beyond the mention that over sixty lodges of Yanktonais Dakota&mdash;perhaps
four hundred persons&mdash;died by this disease about the same time
(<cite>Report, 75</cite>). In 1838 it reached the Pawnee, being communicated
by some Dakota prisoners captured by them, in the spring of that year.
From the best information it seems probable that at least two thousand
Pawnee perished (<cite>Clark, 14</cite>), about double the
whole population of the tribe today. It probably
continued southward through the Osage until it
reached the Kiowa and Comanche the next year,
although it is possible that it may have come more
directly from the east through the emigrating Chickasaw,
who brought it with them to Indian Territory
in the spring of 1838 (<cite>Report, 76</cite>). We learn (<cite>Gregg, 6</cite>)
that the disease ravaged New Mexico in the spring
of 1840 and was again carried east to the frontiers
of the United States by the Santa Fé traders.</p>

peace which, with trifling interruptions, has been kept to this day.
According to the Kiowa account, the first overtures were made by the
Cheyenne, who sent two delegates with proposals, but the Kiowa were
suspicious and sent them back. The Cheyenne then
made a second attempt, with more success, and a peace
was concluded. The Arapaho were included in this
treaty, but, as the Kiowa say, had always been in doubtful
friendship, even when their allies, the Cheyenne,
were at war with the Kiowa. On the occasion of the
notable massacre of Cheyenne, in 1837, the Arapaho
were camped with the Kiowa and left to give the alarm
to their friends. This agrees with the conduct of the
Arapaho in more recent times in remaining neutral while
their Cheyenne confederates were at war with the
whites.</p>

on the upper South Canadian, near the line of New
Mexico, and killed all of them. The Pawnee threw
up breastworks, but, according to the Kiowa account,
an Arapaho medicine-man who knew the
proper medicine song sat down facing the breastworks
and sang the song, moving his hands as
in the hand game, and thus "drove them out,"
when they were killed in line one after another
as they ran. The Kiowa were not present at
the fight, but met and joined the Arapaho just
afterward, when a final treaty of peace was concluded
between the two tribes. Stumbling-bear

"Swift-water river," or <i>Päbo P'a</i>, "American-horse
river," south of Red river, near the Staked
plain, and apparently a head branch of Pease
river in northwestern Texas. The whole Kiowa
tribe was camped on the stream when a party of
Texan soldiers advanced against them. Five
scouts who were in advance of the soldiers were
killed by the Kiowa and their horses captured, but
with the loss of Â´dalhabä´k`ia. Abandoning their camp, the Kiowa
fled, but returning a few days later, they found the soldiers still there
and succeeded in killing another. On account of the number of large
American horses captured by the Kiowa in this encounter the stream
was afterward called by them "American-horse river."</p>

<p>The party encountered by the Kiowa on this occasion was the Texan
Santa Fé expedition, and the fight occurred on August 30, 1841. The
whole story as given by Kendall corresponds remarkably with the
Indian account, which was obtained without any knowledge of the
printed statement on the part of either the author or his informants,
having been handed down orally for over half a century. The affair
occurred, as already stated, on the edge of the Staked plain while the
party was searching for Red river and near a stream which Kendall
calls the Quintufue. Several days previously the expedition had met
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
a number of Kiowa, who had acted insolently, and were apparently
responsible later on for several missing horses and mules.</p>

<p>On the 28th the Texans had crossed the stream and come suddenly
upon the main camp of the Kiowa, who fled at their approach.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we unsaddled our horses and turned them loose before one of our
hunting parties came in and reported that a large body of Indians were in our immediate
vicinity, and that they had driven off an immense <i>cavallada</i> or drove of horses.
Soon another party arrived with information that they had met a small body of
Indians, one of whom spoke Spanish. They said that they were Caygüas, and on
being interrogated concerning the direction towards Santa Fé, gave equivocal
answers. They pointed to the southwest, however, to what appeared a passage
through the hills, and said that was the direction to Chihuahua. They pretended to
know nothing about Rio Colorado or Red river. These Indians were mounted on
fine horses, were dressed in buckskin, and armed with lances and bows and arrows.</p>

<p>The stream upon which we were now encamped appeared to have its source in the
long chain of hills upon our left and ran in nearly a northeast direction. A short
distance above us, occupying a beautiful situation on the same stream, the main
camp of the Indians in our neighborhood was discovered. It had apparently been
just deserted, the inhabitants in their great haste to drive off and secure their
horses not having time even to cache their other property. Tent poles, skins,
numerous rough utensils, besides a quantity of dried buffalo, mustang, and deer
meat were found precisely as they had left them. The latter we appropriated to our
own use, and in our half-starving condition was found extremely palatable....</p>

<p>Two days later they were preparing for their morning start, when suddenly a
young man came dashing into camp from the northward, evidently much agitated,
and announced that a large body of Indians were pursuing a party of our men
directly towards us. Scarcely had he finished speaking before firing was heard but
a few hundred yards distant, a slight roll of the prairie concealing the combatants
from our sight. Fast as they could mount horses a party of some fifty of our men
dashed off toward the scene of strife, while the wagons were drawn up in square,
the cattle and horses brought inside, and every preparation made to resist an attack,
which was now considered certain. The first impression was that the scouting
parties had been entirely cut off and that these successes would induce the Indians
to attack our main body.</p>

<p>Just as the party of our men who had gone out to the relief of their companions
reached the spot the Indians retreated; but their bloody work was done. Scattered
about within the circumference of a few yards were the dead bodies of Lieutenant
Hull and four of our men, stripped, scalped, and horribly mutilated, while the appearance
of the ground gave strong evidence that manfully and with strong hearts they
had resisted the attack of their adversaries. They had left camp but a short time
previous, probably with the hope of finding water, and in returning had been thus
cruelly murdered. But one look at their mangled bodies was sufficient to stir deep
feelings of revenge in every heart, and madly did our men spur their horses in pursuit,
with the vain hope of avenging the death of their companions. The Indians
were at least four times their number, yet they retreated, and being far better
mounted were able to keep out of the way. So near, however, were our men that
they could plainly see the dead bodies of several of the Indians packed upon extra
horses they had with them for that purpose. The prairie warriors always have
horses trained especially to carry off their dead or wounded companions, which they
take with them on going into action, and it is considered one of the greatest calamities
that can befall them if they are compelled to leave one of their number in the
hands of an enemy.</p>

<p>The pursuit of the bloodthirsty Caygüas, for such the Indians proved to be, was
continued by our men until it was evident that they could not be overtaken, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
then reluctantly given up. Several times during the chase the Indians reined up
their well-trained horses on the higher rolls of the prairies and formed in line as if
intending to give battle; but before our men could get within gunshot they were
off again with lightning speed across the plain. On returning to the spot where our
men had fallen, a closer examination showed how hard and desperate had been the
struggle. Lieutenant Hull had received no less than thirty arrow and lance wounds
before he fell, and the broken stock of one of Colt's rifles was still retained in the
grasp of a stout man named Mayby, plainly telling us that he had fought to the last,
and that after discharging the piece he had still continued the combat. The heart
of one of the men was cut out, and had not the Indians been driven off the other
bodies would have been mutilated in the same way. Two of the horses of our
unfortunate comrades were lanced close by; the others were probably in better condition
and more able to run, and had been taken off as spoils by the savages. It
was evident enough that Lieutenant Hull and his men had retreated from the
Indians until they had found it impossible to elude them, and that they had then
thrown themselves from their horses in a body and sold their lives at a fearful rate.
The resistance they made had probably terrified their adversaries and induced them
to fly when they saw our party coming up, although they outnumbered the Texans
at least as three to one.</p>

<p>A party of fifty well-armed men, taking with them shovels, were sent out immediately
on the melancholy errand of burying our
murdered companions, while the main body retraced
their steps toward the Quintufue...</p>

<p>They [the Kiowas] appear to be on terms of peace
with the New Mexicans so far as it suits their interest
and convenience&mdash;no further; at one time trading
and exchanging their skins in amity, and almost in
the same breath making a descent upon the unprotected
frontiers, plundering and frequently murdering
the inhabitants. When we passed through their
country a party of Mexican traders were among them
bartering meal, blankets, and trinkets for buffalo and
deer skins. Some of these Mexicans we afterward
saw, and from them learned that ten of their warriors,
besides a principal chief, were killed by Lieutenant
Hull and his brave companions before they were
overpowered. The traders also gave us an account
of their ceremonies on returning to camp with their scalps and trophies. A wild
dance was executed by the braves in celebration of their victory, while the
women tore their hair and faces and ran naked through the prickly pear and thorn
bushes in token of their grief for the loss of their husbands and brothers (<i>Kendall,
2</i>).</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="d1842">SUMMER 1842</h3>

<p><i>Ä´dăldä K`ádó</i>, "Repeated sun dance." The summer is called by
this name because, as indicated in the figure, it was remarkable for two
sun dances held at the same place on <i>K`ádó P'a</i>, or "Sun-dance creek"
(Kiowa Medicine-lodge creek, which enters the North Canadian near
100°). This could happen only when two individuals in succession had
been so instructed in dreams. In this instance the two dreamers
belonged to different camps and made their requests of the <i>taíme</i>
keeper almost simultaneously. After the first sun dance, when the
<i>taíme</i> priest had gone home, instead of taking down the medicine lodge
and building a new one, they decked it with fresh leaves and held the
second dance in it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<p><i>Gaá-k`ódălte Hém-de Sai</i>, "Winter that Crow-neck died." The chief
Gaá-k`ódălte, or "Crow-neck," died in the late fall of 1842 at <i>Gómgyä

branch of Double-mountain fork of Brazos river in Texas. He was
a Kiñep with a Crow wife (see summer, <a href="#d1836">1836</a>), and was
the adopted father of the German captive, Bóiñ-edal,
already mentioned. The figure shows him in connection

The figure is intended to show a bird's nest at the top of
the center pole of the medicine lodge. This dance, like
the last, was held on <i>K`ádó P'a</i>, which was a favorite
resort for the purpose, as the name indicates, at least five
Kiowa sun dances having been held there. The occasion
is rendered memorable by the fact that a crow built her
nest and laid her eggs upon the center pole of the medicine
lodge after the dance was over.</p>

<p>After the dance a war party under (the former) Big-bow
and Kicking-bird went into Texas and captured a
number of horses. On their return they met a party of soldiers carrying
American flags, and believing them to be Americans (i. e., Northerners,
as distinguished from Texans), whom they regarded as friends,
they shook hands with them and gave them back the horses. They
afterward learned that the whites were Texans, who had adopted this
stratagem to deceive them. The Texans also had with
them a captive Comanche and a Mexican. The Kiowa
rescued the Comanche, but left the Mexican, as no
one wanted him.</p>

<p>The event here recorded occurred at or immediately
after the sun dance in the summer of 1843, but is indicated
above the winter mark as a matter of convenience.
The figure represents a woman wounded in the breast.</p>

<p>After the women have cut down the trees for the
medicine lodge they drag them to the place where the
lodge is to be erected, escorted by a body of warriors
in front and on each side. A warrior frequently invites a woman
to get up and ride behind him, and the invitation is generally accepted.
Among some tribes a procession in which the women ride behind
the men is a feature of the ceremony. Although this is customary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
it sometimes gives rise to jealous feelings on the part of husbands
or lovers. On this occasion, at the invitation of the chief Dohásän,
a woman got upon his horse behind him, which so enraged her husband
that he stabbed her. The woman recovered, and the husband
received no other punishment than a rebuke from Dohásän, who told
him that he ought to have better sense, as he (Dohásän) was a great
chief and an old man&mdash;too old to be running after girls.</p>

<p>Immediately after the dance, a war party under Gíădedéete (Faces-the-line),
went against the <i>Ä´-t'a`ká-i</i> (Timber Mexicans) or Mexicans of
Tamaulipas. They killed a number of people and destroyed
houses, but on recrossing the Rio Grande encountered
a body of Mexican troops when Gíădedéete and two
others were killed.</p>

<p>In the following winter K`ódal-aká-i, "Wrinkled-neck,"
a clerk of the Bents, built a log trading house about a
mile below <i>Gúadal Dóha</i>, "Red bluff," on the South
Canadian, near the mouth of Mustang creek and a few
miles above Adobe Walls, in the Texas panhandle (see
winters <a href="#d1845_46">1845&mdash;46</a> and <a href="#d1864_65">1864&mdash;65</a>). It is also stated that the

of mounted Dakota paid a friendly visit to the Kiowa to
dance and receive presents of ponies, while the Kiowa were engaged
in the sun dance, which was held, like the last two preceding, on <i>K`ádó
P'a</i> or Kiowa Medicine-lodge creek. Although the
Dakota had been at war with the Kiowa when the
latter lived in the north, the two tribes had now
been friends for a long time, so long that the
old men do not remember when the peace was
made.</p>

<p>The Dakota are represented by the figure of a

among the traders as Iroquois beads. The Kiowa
call the Dakota the <i>K'ódalpä-k`íägo</i>, "Necklace
people," and say that the Dakota were the original
wearers of such necklaces.</p>

<p>The explanation appears to be a myth founded on a misconception
of the tribal sign for Dakota, which is the same as for necklace, i.e., a
sweeping pass of the hand across the throat, but commonly translated
"beheaders" when applied to that tribe.

with a wound in his breast. He is further distinguished by the crosses
(stars) with which his war shirt is ornamented. This "medicine shirt"
was covered with dark-blue stars, with a green moon in

He was also called Sét-k`ódalte, "Bear-neck."</p>

<p>The brother of Zépko-eéte (Big-bow, grandfather of
the present old Big-bow, from whom he takes his name)
had been killed in Tamaulipas, and at the last sun dance
Big-bow had "given the pipe" to the Kiowa and their
allies to revenge him. A large party of over two hundred
warriors, including a number of Apache and Comanche,
set out under Big-bow, and after crossing the Rio Grande
and approaching the Salado (<i>Señ P'a</i>, "Cactus river")
they reached a stone fort, in which a small number of
Mexicans, not soldiers, had taken refuge. The Mexicans
had with them their families, also two Indians, who
wore feather crests upon their heads. The fort was so
provided with loopholes that they could fire upon the
attacking party, themselves remaining concealed. The
first attack was repulsed, and Ä´-tahá-ik`í was killed; but the
besiegers succeeded in piling wood against the log walls of the fort and
setting fire to it, when all the defenders were either burned or killed as
they tried to escape. ´dalpepte took part in this affair. After this
fight the Kiowa warriors went farther into Mexico and had another
encounter, in which Big-bow, the leader, was killed, in
consequence of which the war party returned home.</p>

<p>"Giving the pipe" is the ceremonial way of enlisting
recruits for a large war party. For small expeditions
the invitation is given as described in treating of the
<i>Gúa-dágya</i> (winter 1862&mdash;63). At the time of the annual
summer assemblage for the sun dance the organizer of
the expedition, who must necessarily be a person of
some prominence, sends a pipe to the leaders of each
of the principal warrior orders&mdash;<i>Kâ´itséñko</i>, <i>T'äñpéko</i>, etc.&mdash;in turn.
If these leaders sanction the enterprise, they themselves smoke and
present the pipe to the members of their orders at their next meeting,
and all who smoke engage themselves by this act to join the expedition
at the time appointed by the original giver of the pipe. No one is
obliged to smoke against his will, but when a sufficient number have
determined upon the expedition, it takes precedence of all others, and
no other parties or individuals may start out against the enemy in any
direction until this expedition is concluded.

The event which distinguished the dance
was the death of a girl named Tsó-k`ódalte (for Tsó-k`ódalpä-te),

<p>In this winter K`ódal-aká-i, "Wrinkled-neck," built
a trading post on the South Canadian. The picture
is sufficiently suggestive. This post was in the panhandle
of Texas, on the north bank of the South Canadian
(<i>Gúadal P'a</i>, "Red river"), just above Bosque
Grande creek and about 2 miles above the entrance of Red-deer
creek (<i>Ko`gá-i P'a</i>, "Elk creek"). It was in a swampy and well-timbered
location, just west of one of the main trails
from Arkansas river southward. It was owned by
William Bent, called by the Kiowa Máñtahák`ia
("Hook-nose-man," "Roman-nose") who, in the spring
of 1844, had built a trading post, as already noted,
at <i>Gúadal Dóha</i>, higher up on the same river. Both
were in charge of a clerk known to the Kiowa as
K`ódal-aká-i, "Wrinkled-neck."</p>

<p>The removal of Bent's base of operations from the

southward drifting of the tribes, in consequence of
the destruction of the buffalo and the encroachments
of the Dakota, as noted by Frémont and other western
explorers of this period. At the same time the
Kiowa had dealings with another trading post, kept
by William Allison, known to them as Tsódal-héñte,
"No-arm," on Arkansas river at the junction of upper
Walnut creek, in Kansas. As has been stated, the
first trading post ever established in their country was built by Chouteau,
on Cache creek, near the present Fort Sill.</p>

<h3 id="d1846">SUMMER 1846</h3>

<p><i>Pá-guñhéñté Äópäñ-de K`ádó</i>, "Sun dance when Hornless-bull was
made a Kâ´itséñi-k`ia." The figure beside the medicine lodge represents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
a man with the feather headdress and paint of the Kâ´itséñko,
the chief order of the warrior society. There is nothing to indicate
the name of the individual, which is carried in the memory of the artist.
This dance was held on a small tributary of the North Canadian, a
short distance above Kiowa Medicine-lodge creek.</p>

<p>The Yä´`pähe or military organization of the Kiowa has been already
noted. The highest order was the Kâ´itséñko, or "Real dogs (?)," a
select body of ten of the bravest warriors, who were pledged to lead
every desperate charge and to keep their place in the front of battle
until they won victory or death. With this purpose in view, their
leader carried a ceremonial arrow, with which he anchored himself to
the ground by means of a broad sash of elk-skin, which encircled his
neck like a collar and hung down at his right side to the earth; at the
lower end, where it trailed upon the ground, there was a hole, and when
forming line for the charge it was his duty to dismount in front of his
warriors, and, by thrusting the arrow through this hole, to fix himself
in this position, there to remain until his party was victorious, or until,
seeing that all was lost, they gave him liberty
to retreat by pulling out the arrow from
the ground. Should they forget this in the
hurry of their flight, he must remain and die
at his post. During the action, also, he was
obliged to remain stationary, without endeavoring
in any way to avoid the danger.</p>

</div>

<p>Whenever a leader died or was killed
another was selected from among the
Kâ´itséñko to carry the arrow. As the regulations
governing it were adhered to very
strictly, it can readily be understood that
on the occasion of an election the office usually sought the man. As
the Kiowa or other tribes, however, had no desire to sacrifice their
bravest men needlessly, the ceremonial arrow or its equivalent was
carried only when the expedition meant war to the bitter end against
the enemy. In the absence of this emblem of his rank the owner took
his place as an ordinary warrior. He might even lend it to a warrior
who wished to distinguish himself in a war party while the owner
remained at home; but should he do this when any serious expedition
was in preparation, he was considered to be a coward and was degraded
from his rank. The leaders of the Tóñkóñko, "Black legs," another
warrior order, carried a lance somewhat resembling a shepherd's crook
and called a <i>pabón</i>, which had nearly the same purpose as the arrow
of the Kâ´itséñko. The noted chief Set-ängya, who was killed at Fort
Sill in 1871, was the leader of the Kâ´itséñko at that time, and deliberately
invited death in accordance with the obligation of his office.</p>

<p>The Kâ´itséñko initiations took place only on the occasion of a sun
dance and were not of frequent occurrence, so that the event was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
always a matter of considerable importance. The membership was
always kept up to the requisite number of ten. The prominent feature
of the ceremony was the investiture of the new members with the
<i>ópäm-yaípo</i>, or collar sash of the order; hence the verb <i>äópä</i>, "to
initiate into the Kâ´itséñko," which is derived from the verb <i>äópäñ</i>,
"to tie with a rope around the neck." This ceremony evidently
explains the picture from the Dakota calendar (<a href="#fig96">figure 96</a>) which Mallery
translates "they made bands of strips of blankets in the winter," and
goes on to say: "These bands were of mixed colors and reached from
the shoulders to the heels. They also made rattles of deer-hoofs by
tying them to sticks with bead-covered strings. The man has a sash
over his shoulders and a rattle in his hand." The rattle was also a part
of the ceremonial equipment of the Dog-soldiers, and as the Dakota
calendar does not distinguish between seasons, the ceremony may as
easily have taken place in the summer, the ordinary
season for Indian celebrations on the plains.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the ten <i>ópäm-yaípo</i>, the principal one, called the
<i>yaípo-kóñkya</i>, "black rope," was made of elk-skin colored
black and was worn by the leader, the most noted of
whom in recent memory was Set-ängya. Three were
made of red cloth and were called <i>yaípo-gúădal</i>, "red
ropes," while the remaining six were made of elk-skin
dyed red and were called simply <i>ópäm-yaípo</i>. Any of
the Kâ´itséñko was at liberty, if he did not choose to
go on a particular expedition, to lend his sash to
another for the occasion; but if cowardice was suspected
to be his motive for this action he was degraded
from his rank and the sash taken from him and given
to a braver man. Usually each one had a younger
partner (<i>tsä</i>), whom he allowed to wear his sash while in camp or even on
less important expeditions, but when any great war party was on foot,
he must wear it and go himself or run the risk of being considered a coward.
When a wearer became too old to go to war, he formally resigned
his sash to some younger man whom he deemed worthy to wear it, the
recipient acknowledging the honor with presents of blankets or other
property. Sometimes the sash was publicly taken from a warrior grown
too old to wear it in battle, but this was not necessarily regarded as a
degradation when there was no implication of cowardice.</p>

The figure represents a man shot in the mustache or upper lip by an
arrow. The long hair and the breech-cloth shows that he was an
Indian, and the beard or mustache is exaggerated to accentuate the
idea. Mustaches are not infrequent among the older men of the Kiowa,

<p>While the Kiowa were encamped for the winter on Elk creek, a
tributary of the North fork of Red river, within the limits of the
present reservation, a band of Pawnee coming on foot stole a number
of their horses. The Kiowa pursued them northward and overtook
them on the Washita and recovered the horses after a
fight in which one Pawnee was killed. In this action
Set-ängya engaged a Pawnee and was about to stab
him with his lance when, his foot slipped on the snow,
causing him to fall, and the Pawnee sent an arrow
through Set-ängya's upper lip.</p>

was killed." The figure shows the Indian leader
with his war-bonnet and red sleeve. The medicine lodge
is absent, showing that there was no sun dance that
year.</p>

<p>Mânka-gúădal is the Kiowa name of the Comanche
chief Red-sleeve (Îkämosa?), who was killed in an attack
against a party of Santa Fé traders in Kansas, where
the Santa Fé trail crossed Pawnee fork of the Arkansas,
below the present Fort Larned, which was not
built until 1859. Pawnee fork, properly called by the Kiowa <i>Aíkoñ
P'a</i>, "Dark-timber river," is sometimes called by them from this circumstance
<i>Mâ´nka-gúădal-de P'a</i>, "Red-sleeve's river."
According to the story told by the Kiowa, they and
the Comanche were out in search of the Pawnee when
they met at this point a large party of white men with
wagons&mdash;evidently Santa Fé traders. Red-sleeve
wanted to attack them, but Set-ängya, the Kiowa
leader, refused, saying that the whites were their
friends. Red-sleeve then taunted the Kiowa as cowards,
put on his war-bonnet, and, calling his Comanche,
attacked the traders. The Kiowa, wishing to
avoid trouble, drew off. About the first fire a bullet
went through the leg of Red-sleeve and into the
spine of his horse, so that the animal fell, pinning his
wounded rider to the ground. He called on Set-ängya
to help him, but the Kiowa chief refused on account
of the taunt of cowardice, and the white men came
up to Red-sleeve and shot him.</p>

<p>As the government had but little communication with the tribes of
the southern plains until some years after the Mexican war, there is no
direct notice of this occurrence in the official reports, but a letter by
agent Fitzpatrick in the report of the Indian Commissioner for 1848,
the year after the attack upon the train, bears out the statement of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Kiowa that they were anxious to keep peace with the whites, even at
the risk of quarreling with the Comanche and losing some very profitable
business opportunities. Speaking of depredations upon parties
traveling on the emigrant roads and the Santa Fé
trail, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Before leaving there [Bent's fort] last February I had an
interview with some of the Kiaway chiefs, and who have heretofore
been allies of the Comanches. They expressed themselves
as sorry for having anything to do with the war against
us, and promised to quit their country and all intercourse with
the Comanches and join the Cheyennes on the Arkansas, who
are the friends of the whites. This course I approved, and
since my departure from that country last spring learned that
nearly all the Kiaways have moved to the country of the
Cheyennes and Arapahoes and are living in perfect amity with
the surrounding tribes.</p></blockquote>

<p>He also states that there seem to have been fewer
attacks made upon travelers along the Santa Fé road
recently, which he can account for only on the supposition
that "the Indians having, in 1846 and 1847,
secured so much booty by their daring outrages upon
travelers, are now and have been the past summer
luxuriating in and enjoying the spoils" (<cite>Report, 77</cite>).</p>

<h3 id="d1848_49">WINTER 1848&mdash;49</h3>

<p>The Kiowa were camped on Arkansas river near Bent's fort and
made "antelope medicine" (<i>ät'á´kagúa</i>) for a great antelope drive.
Compare the figures from the Dakota calendars of Mallery (<a href="#fig102">figure 102</a>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>The antelope drive was made only in seasons of scarcity, when the
supply of buffalo meat was insufficient, and only in the winter, at
which season the antelope are accustomed to go in herds, while in the
spring and summer they scatter. Such a drive was an event so rare
that one informant over 60 years of age had seen but one in his
lifetime.</p>

<p>When it has been decided to have an antelope drive, the "antelope
medicine-man" builds a special tipi and remains in it all night, singing
his medicine songs until daylight. In the morning he starts out in the
probable direction of the antelope, carrying in each hand a rod about
two feet long decorated at each end with eagle feathers and in the center
with a wheel from which depend the feathers of other carnivorous
birds, his face is painted white, a buffalo robe is thrown over his
shoulder, and a whistle hangs from his neck. He is accompanied by
the whole tribe, mounted and on foot&mdash;men, women, and children. On
arriving at the place selected for the hunt, he sits upon the ground,
facing the direction in which the antelope are supposed to be; in most
other Indian ceremonies the priest faces the east. Beside him sit
some of the principal men, while behind stand several women. The two
men chosen to sit next him on each side must be men known as successful
in the hunt and on the warpath. He plants the two decorated
sticks in the ground in front of him, lights his pipe, and begins to smoke;
after smoking a little while he hands the rods to the men sitting next
him, crossing his right hand over his left as he does so, and giving
their hands a peculiar pressure four times. These two men then rise,
put their hands upon his head&mdash;a gesture of prayer or invocation&mdash;step
across each into the place of the other so as to again reverse the position
of the rods, and then, after the same four hand pressures, again
plant the rods in front of the priest.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 102&mdash;Antelope drives (from the Dakota calendars).</p>
</div>

<p>Two other men, noted war chiefs, then take their places beside the
priest, while the first two sit next them. Grasping the upright sticks
at the top, the priest now sings the first antelope song, blowing upon
the whistle at intervals, while all the surrounding men and women join
in the song, and the four men sitting beside him beat time on the
ground. Four different songs are sung in this manner, the sticks being
grasped lower down at each song, until at the last song the priest pulls
them out from the ground, and, holding them by their lower ends,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
pushes them out alternately in front of himself, while the whole company&mdash;mostly
women now, as the men have gone on ahead&mdash;swell the
chorus, waving their arms with a sweeping motion, as if grasping at the
antelope. Then the two war chiefs place their hands upon his head as
before, and he gives them the sticks, with four other hand pressures.
Taking the rods, the two chiefs run forward on foot at full speed on
diverging lines until they meet two horsemen, to whom they deliver the
rods, and then return to the place where the priest is sitting with the
women and children. In the meantime the hunters have ridden far
out in a semicircle, so as to inclose a large area of country. The two
hunters who have taken the rods now also ride far out on diverging
lines, then turn, cross each other's paths, and return to the priest.
The four songs "draw the minds" of the antelope to the priests, and
the crossing of the paths typifies the surrounding of the game by the
lines of hunters.</p>

<p>The horsemen now begin to close in toward the center, driving before
them the antelope and any other animals that may be within the semicircle;
as they approach, the women close in from, the opposite side,
and as the circle contracts, with the frightened animals running about
within it, they seize them with their hands or with reatas. It is said
that once, in such a drive, a woman caught a
coyote by throwing her arms about its neck. No
shooting is allowed within the circle, but any antelope
that break through are pursued and shot
outside (for other methods, see winter <a href="#d1860_61">1860&mdash;61</a>).</p>

<h3 id="d1849">SUMMER, 1849</h3>

<p><i>Mayíagyă´ K`ádó</i>, "Cramp (i. e., cholera) sun
dance." The figure beside the medicine lodge
represents a man with his limbs drawn up by the
pangs of cholera, which the Kiowa name "the cramp," from its characteristic
feature. Compare the corresponding figure (104) from the
Dakota calendar for the same disease.</p>

<p>This was during the great cholera epidemic that swept the country
in the spring and summer of 1849, which was carried to the plains by
the California and Oregon emigrants and by some of the tribes then in
process of removal from the east. The Kiowa remember this as the
most terrible experience within their history, far exceeding in fatality
the smallpox of nine years before. It was a disease before entirely
unknown to them, and was particularly dreaded on account of its
dreadful suddenness, men who had been in perfect health in the morning
being dead a few hours later. The disease appeared immediately
after the sun dance, which was held on Mule creek (<i>Ädóä P'a</i>, "Tipi
windbreak river"), between Medicine-lodge creek and the Salt fork of
the Arkansas, and, like the previous smallpox, it was brought by visiting
Osage who attended the dance. During the performance a man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
became inspired or "crazy," as in the ghost dance, and prophesied that
something terrible was about to happen after the <i>taíme</i> had been
returned to its box. Hardly was the dance over and the <i>taíme</i> put
away when a man was attacked by this strange disease and died in
a few hours; then another became sick and died as suddenly, and
another, until in a few days the epidemic spread through the tribe,
killing great numbers, including an unusual proportion of medicine-men.
The Kiowa say that half their number perished during its prevalence;
this is probably an exaggeration, but whole families and camps
were exterminated and their tipis were left standing empty and
deserted. Many in their despair committed suicide, but the survivors
saved themselves by scattering in different directions until the disease
had spent its fury.</p>

</div>

<p>The tribes of the lake region and those which had been recently
removed to Indian Territory generally escaped the disease, but among
the wild tribes of the plains, from the Dakota to the Comanche, the
ravages of the cholera during this season were as awful as among
the white population of the eastern states. The western
Dakota, who suffered severely, believed that the disease
had been deliberately introduced by the whites for their
more speedy extermination (<cite>Report, 78</cite>). The agent for
the Pawnee states that up to June of 1849 twelve hundred
and thirty-four persons, or nearly one-fourth of
the tribe, had already died, and the disease was still
making fearful ravages among them, while the survivors
were in such dread of the terrible scourge that no persuasion
could induce them to bury the dead, and within
a short distance of the agency it was not unusual to find the unburied
corpses partially devoured by wolves (<cite>Report, 79</cite>).</p>

<p>In the spring of 1850 an attempt was made to assemble the tribes of
the southern plains for the purpose of making treaties with them to
insure the safety of the emigrant roads. The Comanche, however,
declined to attend on account of the cholera, which they said their
medicine-men had predicted would be communicated to them again by
the whites unless they kept at a proper distance until the grass had
died in the fall, when the cholera would die out with it, and they would
no longer be afraid to meet their white friends (<cite>Report, 80</cite>). This
caused a postponement of the negotiations, which resulted later in the
treaties of Fort Laramie in 1851 and Fort Atkinson in 1853.</p>

<h3 id="d1849_50">WINTER 1849&mdash;50</h3>

<p>The Kiowa killed several of the Pawnee and were received by their
friends with a dance on returning to camp. The figure over the winter
mark (<a href="#fig105">figure 105</a>) represents a Pawnee, as shown by the peculiar shaving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
of the head, with two long scalp-locks or "horns." In this connection
Dunbar says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The name Pawnee is most probably derived from <i>páriki</i>, a horn, and seems to
hare been once used by the Pawnees themselves to designate their peculiar scalp
lock. From the fact that this was the most noticeable feature in their costume the
name came naturally to be the denominative term of the tribe (<i>Clark, 18.</i> See also
summers <a href="#d1841">1841</a> and <a href="#d1851">1851</a>, and winter <a href="#d1852_53">1852&mdash;53</a>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The half circle above represents the circle of dancers opening in the
direction from which the warriors are returning, and the cross in the
center represents a fire made of a pile of buffalo chips around which
they danced.</p>

<p>The Kiowa were camped in two divisions near the Salt fork of Arkansas
river when a war party of Pawnee stole the horses of the first camp,
whose warriors at once started in pursuit. In the meantime another
party of Pawnee stole a number of horses from the Kiowa at the other
camp, who also sent their warriors in pursuit of the thieves. The first
Kiowa party overtook the Pawnee warriors, dismounted, and attacked
them, killing one. While this was transpiring the other band of the
Pawnee came up in the rear and stole the horses from which the riders
had dismounted to fight. The second Kiowa party, coming up behind
the Pawnee, at once attacked them, killed four, and recovered nearly
all the horses.</p>

<p>As the victorious Kiowa warriors approached their home camp after
this double pursuit and encounter, they imitated the cry of a wolf, to
let their friends know that they had killed some of the Pawnee&mdash;designated
as "Wolf-people" in the Kiowa language and in the sign language
of the plains&mdash;and their friends at once formed the circle and began the
dance to receive them, as indicated in the figure. The dance performed
on this occasion is a peculiar one, with a particularly pleasing
song accompaniment.</p>

<p>The scalp dance is called <i>Â´daldá-`gúăn</i>, literally "hair-kill dance."
Should one of the war party have been killed, all the others go into
mourning (<i>dóát</i>) and do not rejoice or paint themselves as they return,
even though bringing back a scalp. In this case they hold no dance,
but sacrifice the scalp to the sun by "throwing it away" on some hillside.
If, on the contrary, they have taken one or more scalps without
the loss of one of their own party, they return to camp in full war dress,
including their war-bonnets, and with faces painted black, to show that
they have killed an enemy. They enter the camp running, to imitate a
charge, firing their guns and discharging arrows, to show how they had
met and struck the foe; if they approached in silence, they might be
mistaken for enemies. Their friends run out to meet them, shouting
"<i>Ĭmkágyä´gya!</i>" ("They are coming in triumph!"), and at once commence
preparations for the dance. The entry is generally made in the
morning, or perhaps just after noon, in order to give plenty of time to
prepare for the dance; should they reach the camp late in the evening,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
the entry is postponed until the next morning. The warriors take the
women up behind them on their horses and ride around the circle singing,
while the scalps, stretched over hoops and painted red on the
inside, are carried at the ends of poles about 6 feet long
by other women in the dance; at night a fire is built in
the center of the circle. As the interpreter said, in his
quaint English, "Everybody very happy time like picnic."
No men excepting those of the returned war
party engage in the dance, but all the women take part.
The dance may continue every afternoon and night for
a month, after which the scalp is usually "thrown
away" in some unfrequented spot by fastening it to the
branch of a tree, or to the end of a pole planted on the
hillside, with a prayer offering it to the sun. This act
of sacrifice was called <i>pä´ñgun</i>, a word signifying "to
give by throwing away."</p>

<p>They were sighted by the Crow scouts at some distance below
and mistaken for Sioux, whereupon the latter made a tragical
rush for our camp to give the alarm. As they appeared in view
across the valley running in single file at a lively speed, occasionally deviating
from a direct line to describe a small circle indicating that they had seen an enemy,
quite an excitement was aroused in the camp. The soldiers
gathered in throngs, while the Crows formed in line, shoulder
to shoulder, behind a pile of buffalo chips placed for the purpose
and stood there swaying their bodies and singing while
the scouts approached. As the leader of the scouts came up
he paused to kick over the pile of buffalo chips, which was
equivalent to a solemn pledge to tell the truth, then sat
down surrounded by his fellow Crows, and after resting a

<p>The Pawnee followed the trail of the Kiowa,

to attract their attention. Two young men of
the Kiowa went out to learn the cause of the

they had come with presents and goods to make
peace and to trade with the Kiowa. The young
men rejoined their party with the news, and the
Kiowa, under chiefs Dohasän and Set-ängya,
turned back to meet the Pawnee band and escort
them to a camping place. As the latter
were on foot, in accordance with their usual
custom, they asked the Kiowa to carry for them
the skin bags which they said contained the
presents. The Kiowa took the bags upon their horses, but as they
went along, knowing well the tricky character of their ostensible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
friends, they opened several of the bags and found them filled, some
with buffalo chips for fuel, and others with arrows, showing that the
Pawnee force had come to fight as soon as a favorable
opportunity offered. Disgusted by this treachery, they at
once attacked and defeated them, killed the chief, who
wore a shell gorget, and captured a boy, who was taken
by Set-ängya himself. It was an expensive capture, however,
as will appear later. The Kiowa lost two prominent
men, Set-äyaí, "Bear-on-trees," and Tén-ät'ánte,
"Little-heart." The fight occurred in Kansas, north of

<h3 id="d1852">SUMMER 1852</h3>

<p><i>Á`pätáte</i> (<i>K`a-t'ógyä</i> or <i>Hâñt'ógyä-k`ía</i>) <i>Ehótal-de Pai</i>,
"Summer that Touch-the-clouds (Knife-shirt, or Iron-shirt-man)
was killed." There was no sun dance this
year. The Pawnee warriors killed a Cheyenne chief who
wore a cuirass. The cross marks over the human figure
represent the cuirass, and the tree with leaves shows
that it occurred during the summer.</p>

<p>At a great Cheyenne camp upon a stream, apparently
in Kansas or Nebraska, known to the Kiowa as <i>Hâ´ñtso
P'a</i>, "Cannonball (literally, metal rock) River," the Cheyenne, Arapaho,
and some Dakota had made medicine for a combined expedition against
the Pawnee, to which they invited the Kiowa and Apache, who were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
camped at the time on <i>Koñyä´daldä P'a</i>, "Black-hill river," in Kansas,
north of the Arkansas. About half the warriors of the two latter tribes
accepted the invitation, and the united force, moving
with all their women, children, and tipi outfits,
started against the Pawnee. They met the enemy,
but were defeated, with the loss of the Cheyenne
chief Wóifdóĭsh, "Touch-the-clouds," called by the
Kiowa Á`pätáte, "Far-up," otherwise known as
Hañt'ógyä-k`ía, "Iron-shirt-man," from a cuirass
which he wore and which had probably been procured
originally from Mexico, where the Kiowa
once captured another.</p>

about four hundred warriors, went in pursuit of the Pawnees

"Red-pet." The figure above the winter mark
shows the Pawnee boy, distinguished

<p>This sun dance is distinguished for a deliberate violation of the <i>taíme</i>
rules by Ten-píäk`ia, "Heart-eater," a noted warrior and medicine-man,
rival of Ansó`te, the <i>taíme</i> keeper, and
father of Set-t'an, the author of this calendar.
One of the strictest regulations of
the sun dance was the taboo against mirrors,
which form part of the toilet equipment
of nearly every Indian, but which
must not even be brought near the <i>taíme</i>
of the Kiowa. Notwithstanding this, Ten-píäk`ia,
in defiance of the medicine and
its priest, deliberately rode around inside
the circle with a small mirror while the
<i>taíme</i> was exposed, and afterward tried
to poison Ansó`te by scraping off the mercury
from the back and mixing it with some
tobacco which he gave to the priest to
smoke. Ansó`te took one puff, but detecting
something wrong, put away the pipe,
saying, "There is something there of which
I am afraid." Soon afterward Ten-píäk`ia, while hunting buffalo, was
thrown from his horse and killed, which was regarded
as a speedy punishment of his sacrilege.</p>

<p>Although Indian tradition records frequent instances
of careless and unthinking neglect of some of the numerous
taboos and other regulations in connection with
sacred matters, such a deliberate defiance of their ordinances
is almost unexampled; more rare, indeed, than
heresy in the old days when Europe held but one religious
doctrine. It is of interest as showing that even
among savages attempts are sometimes made by bolder
spirits to break away from the bonds of mental slavery.
A somewhat similar incident is recorded for 1861.</p>

<h3 id="d1853_54">WINTER 1853&mdash;54</h3>

<p>Soon after the last sun dance a war party went into
Chihuahua (<i>Toñhéñ-t'a`ká-i-dómbe</i>, "waterless Mexican
country"), east of the Sierra Madre, where they met and
attacked a mule train. The Mexicans made a circle of
the wagons, with the mules on the inside, and prepared
to defend themselves. A distinguished warrior named
<i>Pä´ñgyägíate</i> succeeded in entering the circle and was
striking the mules with his bow, equivalent to putting his seal of
ownership upon all thus struck, when he was shot and killed by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Mexican who had approached him unseen. No other Kiowa was killed.
Pá-tadal was one of this party.</p>

<p>The brother of Set-ĭmkía, "Pushing-bear," more
commonly known as Stumbling-bear, had been killed
by the Pawnee, and at this dance he sent the pipe
around as a summons for a great expedition against
that tribe. Other tribes were invited to join the
Kiowa, and a large war party set out, consisting
of several hundred warriors of seven tribes&mdash;Kiowa,
Apache, Comanche, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Osage, and
some Crows. They crossed the Arkansas and proceeded to the northeast
until they reached <i>Gúigyä P'a</i>, "Pawnee river" (Smoky Hill),
where they met a small party of about eighty <i>Säkíbo</i> (i. e., Sauk and
Fox), with a few Potawatomi, three cognate tribes which had been
removed from beyond the Mississippi to reservations in eastern Kansas.
The latter advanced against the Kiowa, who summoned them to
halt, but notwithstanding the great disparity in numbers, the eastern
Indians at once attacked the prairie warriors. Securing a sheltered
position, and being all well armed with rifles with which "they hit
every time," while the Kiowa and their allies were in the open prairie
and armed chiefly with bows, the Sauk not only kept them off but
defeated them with the loss of about twenty killed, among whom were
twelve of the Kiowa, including <i>Tseñ-kóñkyä</i>, "Black-horse," a prominent
war chief.</p>

<p>This is the story as given by the Kiowa themselves, who ascribe
their disastrous defeat by a comparative handful of men to the rifles
in the hands of the Sauk warriors. This battle occurred either on
Smoky-hill or Saline river, in Kansas, about midway between the present
Fort Harker and Fort Hays.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

<p>Although Set-ĭmkía says that the expedition was originally organized
against the Pawnee to avenge the killing of his brother by that
tribe, other informants state that it was organized and led by Tseñ-kóñkyä,
the man who was killed, for the special purpose of exterminating
the immigrant tribes, and this statement agrees with the official
accounts. The Indian Report for 1854 contains an extended notice of
this great war party, which went after wool and came back shorn.</p>

<p>In the summer of that year the agent for the southern plains tribes
started for the Indian rendezvous near Fort Atkinson, on the Arkansas,
with a large train of goods for distribution in accordance with the
terms of the treaty made at that point in the previous year, having first
sent messengers ahead to inform the Indians of his approach.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Indians were encamped on Pawnee fork, at the crossing of the Santa Fé road,
where they were collected in larger numbers than had ever been known to assemble
on the Arkansas before. Old traders estimate the number at twelve to fifteen hundred
lodges, and the horses and mules at from forty to fifty thousand head. The
entire Kiowa and Prairie Comanches were there; several hundred of Texas or Woods
Comanches had come over; the Prairie Apaches, one band of Arapahoes and two
bands of Cheyennes and the Osages composed the grand council. They had met
for the purpose of forming a war party, in order, as they in their strong language
said, to <i>wipe out</i> all frontier Indians they could find on the plains. Two days previous
to my arrival they broke up camp and started north. As soon as I heard that they
were gone I sent two runners to try and bring them back. They, however, declined
coming, and sent word that they would soon return, as it would take but a short
time to clear the plains of all frontier Indians. They were doomed to be disappointed,
as other nations, great in their own imaginations, have been. At some
place near Kansas river they met about one hundred Sac and Fox Indians and the
fight commenced, and from their own account lasted about three hours, when, to
their great surprise, the combined forces were compelled to retreat, leaving their
dead on the field, which Indians never do unless badly whipped. They report their
loss at about sixteen killed and one hundred wounded. From the best information
I can get, the Sacs and Foxes were as much surprised at the result as the others,
for there is no doubt but that they would have run too if they could have seen a
hole to get out at. They had taken shelter in a ravine and were for a long time surrounded.
The prairie Indians were armed with the bow and arrow, while the others
had fine rifles. One is a formidable weapon in close quarters, but worthless at more
than about fifty yards. The rifle told almost every shot. It is easily accounted for
why one hundred whipped fifteen hundred. The former had a weapon to fight with;
the latter had none at the distance they were fighting. I learn that the Sacs and
Foxes lost six killed, but they were killed with the rifle. The Osages have fine guns,
and they must have shot them, for I am certain the other Indians have nothing in
the shape of guns, except a few Northwest shotguns, and they are of but little use.
The Sacs and Foxes are satisfied that the Osages did them the only damage they
received, and as an evidence I learn that war has been declared between the nations,
and already some scalps have been taken. This may save the government from
whipping them (the Osages), as it is certain somebody will have it to do soon
(<cite>Report, 82</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>In his report for the same year the Indian superintendent says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am officially advised that on the arrival of Agent Whitfield at Fort Atkinson, on
the Arkansas river, with the annuity goods for the Comanches, Kiowas, and Apaches,
in July last, he found that they had all gone on a war party against the tribes of the
north, confident from their numbers, estimated at fifteen hundred, to gain an easy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
victory over any tribes they should encounter. In the vicinity of Smoky Hill they
came up with a party of Sacs and Foxes and a few Pottawatomies, the whole not
exceeding two hundred [<i>sic</i>] in number. The Comanches, believing, to use the words
of one of their chiefs, that they could "eat up" so small a force in a few minutes,
made a general charge. The Sacs allowed them to approach until within a hundred
yards, when they opened upon them a well-directed fire from their rifles, which,
being unexpected, appalled, and for the moment checked, their assailants. Three
times these charges were repeated, and each time with a like fatal result. The
Comanches at length retired, crestfallen and dispirited, having twenty-six killed
and over one hundred wounded. On their return to Fort Atkinson their appearance
and deportment were quite changed. They seemed humble and dejected, and quietly
and submissively received their annuities and retired. The loss
of the Sacs and Foxes is reported to be very inconsiderable
(<cite>Report, 83</cite>).</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>The agent for the Sac and Fox tribes gives a sequel which illustrates
Indian vengeance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On the second of August, by the request of the chiefs and head
men of the Sac and Fox tribe of Indians, I reported to the honorable
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, through your office, an
account of an attack made on the Sacs and Foxes by the Comanches,
Arapahoes, and Osages, about the tenth of July, one hundred
miles west of Fort Riley. Some five or six days ago a Sac Indian,
who had a brother killed in that battle, left here by himself, went
within four hundred yards of an Osage encampment, met two
Osage men, shot one down and went up and scalped him; could
have killed the other, but wished him to live to carry the news
of what he had done to the Osage camp; waited until he had
done so; heard the cries and lamentations of those in the camp
for their dead kinsman, mounted his horse and returned with his
scalp. The nation immediately upon his return moved to within
a mile of the agency, where they are now dancing with joy and
triumph over the trophy brought back in this warlike achievement
to them (<cite>Report, 84</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Whirlwind, the famous war chief of the southern
Cheyenne, who died in 1895, had every feather shot
away from his war bonnet in this engagement, which he always
declared was the hardest fight he had ever been in. Notwithstanding
this, he was not wounded, owing to the protecting power of a medicine
hawk which he wore upon his war bonnet! He said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When all the feathers were shot away the hawk was not hit. Balls went to
the right and left, above and below me. I was mounted and the Sacs and Foxes
were on foot in a hollow like a buffalo wallow. It was the Great Spirit and the
hawk which protected me (<cite>Clark, 15</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="d1854_55">WINTER 1854&mdash;55</h3>

<p>Gyaí`koaóñte "Likes-enemies," is killed by the <i>Ä´lähó</i>. He is identified
in the picture by his shield, which is recognized as one made by
Set-pate, "He-bear," and by the collar of the Kâitséñko, to which order
he belonged. The zigzag stroke touching his breast is intended to show
that he was killed by a bullet.

<p>According to one statement, the Kiowa warriors had gone against the
Osage on Arkansas river and found their camp with a number of horses
hobbled near by. They waited until night and
then made an attempt to steal the horses, but
were ambuscaded by the Osage and this man was
killed. Another informant states that the Indians
concerned were not the Osage (<i>K`apä´to</i>, "Shaved-heads,")
but the <i>Ä´lähó</i> (Kwapa? Omaha?), described
as a tribe living to the northward of
the Osage and similar to them in language and
costume. As the Kiowa generally state that they
have been friends with the Osage since the peace
of 1834, and more particularly as they had been
allies against the Sauk only a few months before
this occurrence, the latter story is probably
correct.</p>

suggestive. There was no sun dance this
summer. The weather was extremely hot
and the grass dried up, in consequence of
which the horses became so weak that
when traveling the Kiowa were frequently
obliged to halt and sit down to allow the
animals to rest.</p>

This dance was held at a place where there was an abundance of
prickly-pears, at the mouth of a small creek, probably Caddo or Rate
creek, entering Arkansas river about 10 miles below
Bent's fort, in Colorado. It was held late in
the fall, when the prickly-pears were ripe, instead
of in midsummer, as usual, and the women gathered
a large quantity. This circumstance has given the
distinctive name to the <i>k`ádó</i>. The sweet fruit of
the tuna is much prized by the Indians, who eat it
raw, while the fleshy leaves are used as a mordant
in their painting upon buckskin.</p>

<p>After the last sun dance, while the Kiowa, Cheyenne, and Arapaho were
still camped near Bent's fort, a Kiowa war party under Big-bow and
Stumbling-bear went against the Navaho, while the rest, men and
women, under old Lone-wolf, went after buffalo, leaving their tipis
rolled up in care of Bent. On their return they found the Cheyenne in
possession of their tipis, and on complaining to Bent he said, "I
have given them to my people" (i. e., the Cheyenne). A quarrel
ensued, in which the Cheyenne shot Lone-wolf's horse and slightly
wounded one Kiowa and drove the others away, retaining possession of
the tipis. This appears to have been the most serious break between
the two tribes since they had made peace in 1840.</p>

<h3 id="d1857">SUMMER 1857</h3>

<p><i>Ä´potó Ek`iädă´-de K`ádó</i>, "Sun dance when the
forked stick sprouted." The figure (121) represents a forked stick, with
leaves, growing out from the side of the medicine lodge.</p>

<p>This dance was held on the north side of Salt fork of the Arkansas
(<i>Ätäntaí P'a</i>, "Salt river") at a small creek, probably Elm creek, a
considerable distance below upper Mule creek (<i>Ädóä P'a</i>) in Oklahoma.
A Kiowa named K`ayä´ñte, "Falls-over-a-bank," owned a sacred <i>ä´poto</i>,
or two-pronged stick of <i>ä`gótä</i>, or chinaberry wood about four feet long,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
trimmed with wild sage, which had been given him by his uncle Kóñabíñate
or Kóñate, "Black-tripe." It was his medicine, which he carried
publicly only in the sun dance, and no one else had such a stick.
He carried it on this occasion, keeping time to the dance with it, and
at the end of the ceremony planted it, with the fork down, inside the
medicine lodge as a sacrifice. On returning to the place next year the
Kiowa found that it had been reversed by someone and had taken root
and put forth green leaves. This was the more remarkable, as it had
previously been stripped of its bark. The news of the phenomenon
spread through the tribe and confirmed the previous impression concerning
the mysterious powers of the <i>ä´poto</i>. Ten years later, on the
occasion of the treaty of Medicine Lodge, the Kiowa visited the spot
and found that the rod had grown into a tree and was still alive. It
is just possible that K`ayä´ñte, who is still living, could explain the
matter.</p>

<p>After this dance two war parties started out, one against the
<i>Pä´sûñko</i> (<i>Paseños</i>, Mexicans of El Paso), and another, consisting principally
of Comanche under the chief Mäwi, against the Sauk and Fox
tribes, who had so badly punished them three years
before. They met the Sauk northeast of the scene
of the former battle and had an engagement in
which several of the Sauk were killed. Gaápiatañ
was one of this party. No mention of these expeditions
occurs in the official reports.</p>

<p>The story of the origin of the <i>ä´poto</i> staff is
romantic, and throws light upon several interesting
points of Indian belief and custom. Eighteen years
before this sun dance (i. e., in 1839) a small party of
about twenty Kiowa warriors led by Gúădalóñte, "Painted-red,"
started against the <i>Pä´sûñko</i>, already mentioned. The old chief Dohasän
accompanied the party, but not as leader. It should be noted
that usually every war party had a substitute leader or lieutenant, who
took command in case of the death of the leader. For some reason
they made no attack upon El Paso, probably because they found it too
vigilantly guarded, but stayed only one night and started the next day
on their return. In the desolate Jornada del Muerto, between the lower
Pecos and the Rio Grande, they halted for the night at a spring coming
out of a cave since known to the Kiowa as <i>Tsó-dói-gyätä´dă´-dée</i>, "the
rock house (cave) in which they were surrounded." None of the Kiowa
can define its exact location, but they describe it as a deep rock well
with a large basin of water, and on one side of it a cave running under
the rock from the water's edge. Pope's statement shows it to have been
the Hueco Tanks, in western Texas, just south of the New Mexico line.
While resting there they were surrounded by a large force of Mexican
soldiers, who killed several of their horses and forced them to take
refuge in the cave. The Mexicans had with them several Mescalero
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
Indians (E´sikwita), who, however, were rather doubtful allies, as one
of them, who spoke Comanche, shouted to the Kiowa in that language,
encouraging them to hold out.</p>

<p>On being driven into the cave the Kiowa found themselves cut off from
both food and water. They were watched so closely by the Mexicans
that they could only venture out to the edge of the water under cover
of darkness to get a hasty drink or cut from the dead horses a few
strips of putrefying flesh, which they had to eat raw. One man was
shot in the leg while thus endeavoring to obtain water. From the
stench of the dead horses, and the hunger, thirst, and watchfulness,
they were soon reduced to a terrible condition of suffering.</p>

<p>On exploring the cave to see if there might be any means of escape,
they found that it extended a considerable distance, and at the farther
end was a hole opening to the surface. One of them climbed up and
thrust his head out of the opening, but was seen by the soldiers, who
at once effectually closed the hole. It was evident that the Mexicans
were afraid to attack the Indians and were determined to keep them
penned up until they were starved. To add to their distress, the decaying
carcasses of the horses soon made the water unfit to drink. After
ten days of suffering they realized that a longer stay meant dying in the
cave, and it was resolved to make a desperate attempt to escape that
night.</p>

<p>The sides of the well were steep and difficult, but they had noticed
a cedar growing from a crevice in the rock, the top of which reached
nearly to the height of the cliff, and it seemed just possible that by its
means they might be able to climb out. That night, after dark, they
made the attempt and succeeded in gaining the top without being discovered
by the soldiers on guard. One only, the man who had been
shot in the leg, was unable to climb. He implored his comrades to
take him with them, but finding that impossible, they answered that it
was his life against theirs and if they remained with him or lost time
in trying to get him out they would all perish together. They urged
him to have a strong heart and die like a warrior; he calmly accepted
the inevitable, saying only; "When you get home, tell my comrades to
come back and avenge me." Then he sat down by the side of the well
to await death when daylight should reveal him to his enemies. His
name, Dágoi, deserves to be remembered.</p>

<p>Dohasän was the first to reach the top; he belonged to the Kâitséñko,
and it is said that before leaving the cave he had sung the song of that
warrior order in which they bid defiance to death, the same which
Set-ängya afterward chanted before he sprang upon the guard and was
riddled with bullets by the soldiers.</p>

<p>As they emerged they saw the fires of their enemies burning in various
directions about the mouth of the cave. The Indians were sheltered
by the darkness, but some of the soldiers heard a slight noise
and fired at random in that direction, and seriously wounded Koñate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
who was shot through the body. The Kiowa succeeded in making
their escape, probably helping themselves to some of the Mexican
horses, and carried with them their wounded comrade until they reached
a noted spring, perhaps on the edge of the Staked plain, known as
<i>Pai-k`op tóñtep</i>, "Sun-mountain spring," from its circular shape and its
situation on the top of a mountain. By this time Koñate's wounds
were in such condition that it seemed only a question of a few hours
when he would die. Finding themselves unable to carry him in his
helpless condition across the desolate plains, his friends reluctantly decided
to leave him to his fate. Placing him within reach of the water,
they raised over him an arbor of branches to shield him from the sun,
and rode away, intending on reaching home to send back a party, in
accordance with their custom, to bring back his bones for burial.</p>

<p>Deserted by his companions, his wounds putrefying under the hot
sun, Koñate lay stretched out by the spring silently awaiting the end.
The sun went down and day faded into night, when far off on the hillside
he heard the cry of a wolf; the wounded man roused himself from
his stupor and listened; again he heard the cry of the wolf, but this
time from another direction and evidently near; despair seized him as
he realized that the coyotes had scented their prey and were gathering
to the feast, and now he heard the patter of the light feet and the sniffing
of the animal as a wolf prowled around him; but instead of springing
upon the helpless man and tearing him in pieces, the wolf came up
and gently licked his wounds, then quietly lay down beside him.</p>

<p>Now he heard another sound in the distance, the <i>tsó dal-tem</i>, or eagle-bone
whistle of the sun dance; it approached, and he heard the song of
the <i>k`ádó</i>, and at last the spirit of the <i>taíme</i> stood before him and said:
"I pity you, and shall not let you die, but you shall see your home and
friends again." The <i>taíme</i> then sent a heavy rain to clear out his
wounds and afterward talked long with him, giving him instructions
for a new shield and conferring upon him mysterious powers of medicine,
of which the proof and emblem should be the <i>ä´poto</i> staff, which
he instructed him to make after his return. Then the spirit left him,
saying, "Help is near." The Kiowa insist that all this was not a
dream or vision, but an actual waking occurrence; but of course most
of it was the delirium of fever.</p>

<p>As his comrades proceeded on their way, they met six Comanche
warriors on their way to Mexico, to whom they told the story of their
encounter, also that they would find Koñáte's dead body at the spring,
and asked them to cover it from the wolves. Then they parted, the
Kiowa continuing on to the northward, while the Comanche proceeded
toward the spring, where they intended to camp for the night. On
arriving, they were astonished to find Koñáte alive and in somewhat
better condition than when his comrades had left him. Seeing that
there was a chance of saving his life, the Comanche washed his wounds
and fed him; next morning they put him upon one of their extra horses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
and abandoning their proposed raid turned back and brought him
safely to his friends and tribe, where he fully recovered and lived for
many years. A few years after his return, he made several shields,
as directed by the <i>taíme</i>, one of which still exists in possession of
Dr J. D. Glennan, U.S.A., now stationed at Fort Clark, Texas; he also
made the sacred <i>ä´poto</i>, which he carried for some time in the annual
sun dance, and afterward bestowed it upon his son (i. e., nephew) K`ayä´ñti,
who still lives, now an old man. Koñáte subsequently assumed
the name, of Pá-tadal, "Lean-bull," which he conferred later on its
present owner, commonly known to the whites as Poor-buffalo.</p>

<p>Captain Pope, who visited the Hueco tanks in 1854, describes the
peculiar formation of the cave springs and mentions the Gúadalóñte
fight of some years before, his statements being evidently derived from
the Mexicans, who were disposed to magnify their
own part in the affair. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Besides the water contained in the tanks there are numerous
holes and crevices in the mountains, which contain
sufficient for every purpose to last for a considerable time.
It is proper to remark that animals can not drink from the
tanks; the water is taken out in buckets and thrown down
the rocks until all have been supplied. Thus watering is a
matter of time and labor. The peculiar formation of these
mountains, their innumerable caverns and hiding places,
seem to have been intended for a refuge for the Indians; nor
have they neglected to avail themselves of its advantages.
In one instance, however, they "reckoned without their
host." About fourteen years ago these Arabs of New Mexico,
the Apaches, having made a desperate foray upon the Mexicans,
retreated with their plunder to these mountains. The
Mexicans surprised and surrounded them, hemming them up
in the rocky ravine forming the eastern tank. Here an engagement
took place, in which the Indians were totally defeated and nearly exterminated,
only two or three escaping. It is said that upward of one hundred of
them were killed (<cite>Pacific Railroad, 1</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Kiowa camped this winter on Two-butte creek (<i>Ä´zót P'a</i>,
"Driftwood creek"), a southern tributary of the Arkansas, below Bent's
Fort in Colorado. A band of Pawnee came on foot and stole six bunches
of horses, including all those of T'ébodal and Set-ängya; among them
were three spotted mules. The Kiowa pursued the thieves for three
days and came in sight of them at sunset; they intended to strike
them next morning and get the stock, but that night a snowstorm
came on and stopped the pursuit; however, they killed one Pawnee who
had been crippled by the cold. The figure above the winter mark

Chihuahua and captured a number of horses. They had recrossed the Rio

sunrise by a pursuing party of Mexicans. The Indians fled and
escaped, excepting Gúi-k`áte, "Wolf-lying-down," who rode a mare
which was delayed by a colt in following, and was therefore unable to
get away from the enemy, who shot and killed him.</p>

<p><i>Ahíñ-dóha K`adó</i>, "Cedar-bluff sun dance." The
figure at the side of the medicine lodge
is intended to represent a cedar tree on
a bluff.</p>

<p>This dance was held at a place known
to the Kiowa as "Cedar bluff," on the northern side
of Smoky-hill river (<i>Pe P'a</i>, "Sand river"), about
opposite the mouth of Timber creek, near the present
Fort Hays, Kansas. The Kiowa state that they
went so far north on account of the abundance of
buffalo in that vicinity. This dance is sometimes
also called <i>Ää'otón-de K`adó</i>, "Timber-clearing sun
dance," from the fact that most of the trees once
there had been cut down.</p>

<p>Gíaká-ite, "Back-hide," died, and a cross was afterward erected over
his bones. The figure of the individual, with the cross above his head,
explains itself. The <i>gíăká-i</i> or "back hide" (<a href="#KIOWA-ENGLISH_GLOSSARY">see the Glossary</a>) is a
piece of rawhide worn over the shoulders by women, to protect the
back when carrying wood or other burdens.</p>

<p class="hang2"><small><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 126&mdash;Winter 1859&mdash;60&mdash;Gíaká-ite died.</small></p>
</div>

<p>Gíaká-ite was a very old man, and died on the Staked plain (<i>Päsä´ngya</i>,
"Edge prairie"), at a salt pond called <i>Tóñ-kóñ</i>, "Black water,"
perhaps the Agua Negra, just within the Texas boundary. Having
become so old and enfeebled in mind and body as to be a continual
source of trouble and anxiety, his unfeeling relatives deliberately abandoned
him. Shortly before this the old man asked Dohasän, who was
of his own family, where they intended to camp next winter. The chief
brutally replied, "What is that to you? We shall not
take you with us." The poor old man, thinking it a joke,
laughed and said, "How can you leave me behind? There
are not many chiefs, and you can't afford to lose one."
However, on their next move they left him behind to shift
for himself, and as he was too feeble to keep up with the
party he died alone. Whether he died a lingering death
of starvation or met a quicker fate by the coyotes, is unknown;
but some time afterward a small war party of the
Kiowa, passing near the spot, found his skeleton, over
which kind hands&mdash;probably Mexican travelers&mdash;had
erected a rude cross.</p>

<p>The winter before his death, while the Kiowa were on
the move somewhere in the same neighborhood, Âdalpepte
and his wife, being some distance behind the others, met
the old man mounted upon an animal nearly as feeble as
its rider, vainly endeavoring to catch up with the main
party. It was bitterly cold and he had no blanket. Âdalpepte,
unable to endure the sight, generously took off his own buffalo robe
and threw it over the old man's shoulders, saying to him, "Take it; I
am young and can stand more." Thus, before we make an estimate of
Indian character from this story we must decide how far the generosity
of the one act offsets the heartless cruelty of the other. It is but fair
to state that Gíaká-ite had no immediate relatives who were in condition
to help him, as his children were dead and his grandson was but
a small boy, so that no one felt directly responsible for his welfare.
Abandonment of the aged and helpless was not infrequent among the
prairie tribes, but was rather a hard necessity of their wandering life
than deliberate cruelty, as generally the aged are treated with the
greatest respect and consideration. This is particularly the case
among tribes who are less nomadic in habit.

<p id="Tenebadai">T'ené-badaí, "Bird-appearing," was killed. The figure shows a man
shot through the body, with blood streaming from his mouth, while the
bird above is intended to indicate his name. As there was no sun
dance this year, the medicine lodge is omitted.</p>

<p>A part of the Kiowa tribe was south of the Arkansas, while the rest,
with the Kwáhadi and other western Comanche, under the chiefs
Täbi-nä´năkă (Hears-the-sun) and Ĭsä-hä´bĭt (Wolf-lying-down), were
camped north of that stream, when one day the latter party discovered
a large body of people crossing the river. Täbi-nä'năka went out to
reconnoiter, and returned with the report that there were a great many
of them and that they were probably enemies. The Kiowa and Comanche
at once broke camp and fled northward, and on their way met the
Cheyenne and Arapaho, to whom they told the news, whereupon the
latter also fled with them. By this time it had been discovered that the
pursuers were white soldiers, accompanied by a large body of Caddo,
Wichita, Tonkawa, and Pénätĕka Comanche. As they
fled, the Kiowa and their allies kept spies on the lookout,
who one night reported their enemies asleep, when they
turned and attacked them at daylight, killing a soldier,
but losing a Comanche named Silver-knife (properly Tin-knife,
<i>Hâ´ñt'aiñ-k`á</i> in Kiowa), who was shot through the
neck with an arrow, and a Kiowa named T'ené-badaí,
"Bird-appearing," noted for his handsome appearance,
who was killed by a Caddo. The engagement took place
in Kansas, somewhere northward from Smoky-hill river
(<i>Pe P'a</i>).</p>

<p>The Pénätĕka Comanche lived in Texas, near the settlements,
and associated more with the Caddo, Wichita,
and whites than with their western kinsmen, the Kwáhadi Comanche,
against whom and their allies, the Kiowa and Apache, they several
times aided the whites.</p>

<p>There is no direct notice of this engagement in the Indian Report,
but the Commissioner states that peace had prevailed among the treaty
tribes during the year, with the conspicuous exception of the Kiowa,
whose increasing turbulence would seem to render military operations
against them advisable. In another place he states that both the
Kiowa and Comanche were known to be hostile, and that the army had
been ordered to chastise them, as the only way to make them respect
their engagements and to stay their murderous hands. In going to
Bent's fort, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Citizens of the United States in advance of me as I went out, and also on my return,
were brutally murdered and scalped upon the road. It is a fact also worthy of
remark that the murders were committed almost within range of the guns at Fort
Larned. The Indian mode of warfare, however, is such that it is almost impossible
to detect them in their designs. They cautiously approach the Santa Fé road, commit
the most atrocious deeds, and flee to the plains (<cite>Report, 85</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>This winter is known as <i>Â´dálká-i Dóha Sai</i>, "Crazy-bluff winter."
While the Kiowa were encamped on the south side of the Arkansas,
near the western line of Kansas, a man named Gaá-bohónte, "Crow-bonnet,"
the brother of the man who had been killed by the Caddo the
preceding summer, raised a party for revenge. They went to the
Caddo camp on the head of Sugar creek, in the present Caddo and
Wichita reservation, where they encountered a Caddo looking for his
horses. They killed and scalped him, and brought back with them the
scalp over which the Kiowa held a scalp dance at a bluff on the south
side of Bear creek (<i>T'á-zótă´ P'a</i>, "Antelope-corral river"), near its
head, between the Cimarron and the Arkansas, near the western line
of Kansas. From the rejoicing on this occasion the place
took the name of Foolish, or Crazy bluff.</p>

<p>About the same time a war party went into Texas,
but lost three men.</p>

<p>The <i>zótă´</i> or driveway for catching antelope was an
open corral of upright logs, stripped of their branches,
with an entrance, from which diverged two lines of posts
set at short distances from one another and covered with
blankets to resemble men. The antelope were surrounded
on the prairie and driven toward the corral until they
came between the converging lines of posts, when it was
an easy matter to force them into the closed circle, where
they were slaughtered. The <i>zótă´</i> was used for catching
antelope at any season of the year. It was not used for deer, as the
deer could jump over an ordinary corral.</p>

<p>For a description of another method, the <i>ät'ákagúa</i>, or "antelope
medicine," see Winter <a href="#d1848_49">1848&mdash;49</a>. Antelope make regular trails from
their shelter places to their grazing grounds, and the Indians sometimes
caught them by digging a large pitfall along such a trail&mdash;an
entire band assisting in the work&mdash;and carrying the excavated earth a
long distance away, so as to leave no trace on the trail, after which the
pitfall was loosely covered with bushes and grass. The hunters then concealed
themselves until the herd approached, when they closed in behind
and drove the frightened animals forward until they fell into the pit.</p>

<p>Wild horses also were sometimes taken in driveways called <i>t'á-tséñ-zótă´</i>
("wild-horse driveway"), which were set up near the water holes
in the Staked plain, usually in summer, when the streams were dry
and the animals were obliged to resort to these places for water. A
steep cliff was sometimes utilized to form one side of the corral or driveway.
In hunting buffalo the Indians sometimes built converging leadways
to the edge of a cliff and then drove the animals over the precipice.

</div>

<p>This dance was held near a canyon, on the south bank of upper Walnut
creek, entering the Arkansas at the Great Bend in Kansas. The
event recorded throws another curious light on Indian belief. At the
sun dance no one but the <i>taíme</i> priest must attempt any "medicine,"
but on this occasion a man called Dogúatal-edal, "Big-young-man,"
became "crazy" and committed sacrilegious acts, tearing off his feather
headdress and throwing it upon the <i>taíme</i> image, and afterward,
when they were smoking to the sun, taking the pipe and throwing it
away. No reason is given for these strange actions, except that he
was temporarily crazy, as he had never acted strangely before, but the
Indians believe that, as his conscience troubled him after he came to his
senses, he gave this horse to the <i>taíme</i> as an atonement.
At the close of the dance he tied a spotted
horse to one of the poles inside the medicine lodge
and left it there, where it probably died. Such a
thing as tying a horse to the medicine lodge had
never before been heard of, although a horse was
sometimes sacrificed to the sun by tying it to a tree
out upon the hills and leaving it there to perish.
The old war chief Gaápiatañ twice sacrificed a
horse in this manner, once during the cholera of 1849, when he offered
a gray horse as a propitiatory sacrifice for himself, his parents, and
brothers and sisters; also again, in the smallpox epidemic of 1861&mdash;62
(see <a href="#d1861_62">next year</a>), he offered a fine black-eared horse, hobbling it and
tying it to a tree, with a prayer to the spirit of the disease to take his
horse and spare himself and his children and friends. On both occasions
his faith appears to have been rewarded, as none of his relatives
died. The horse offered on this last occasion was of the kind called
<i>t'á-kóñ</i>, "black-eared," considered by the Kiowa to be the finest of all
horses.</p>

<p>Dogúatal-édal afterward led a small war party, seven in number,
including one woman, into Mexico. None of them ever returned, all
the warriors having been killed, probably by Ute warriors, among
whom the woman was found living by Big-bow and his companions
when they visited that tribe in 1894. It was on this occasion that the
Kiowa tribe gained the first intimation concerning the fate of the party.
The woman was then the wife of a Ute and the mother of three of his
children. Big-bow wanted her to return home with them, especially
as her son by her Kiowa husband was still living, but her Ute husband
was unwilling to come, and she refused to leave him and her three
other children.

and <a href="#d1892">1892</a>). The Kiowa were camped for the winter about the Arkansas,
in the vicinity of <i>Âdalka-i Doha</i>, in southwestern Kansas, and a party
went into New Mexico to trade. They stopped at a town in the mountains
at the head of the South Canadian, where smallpox
was prevalent at the time, and the people warned them
of the danger; they therefore left, but one Kiowa had
already bought a blanket, which he refused to throw
away, although requested to do so. On returning to their
home camp, about New Year, he was attacked by the
disease and died, and the epidemic spread through the
tribe; many died, and the others scattered in various
directions to escape the pestilence. The Cheyenne, Arapaho,
Dakota, and other tribes also suffered greatly at
the same time, as appears from the official report (<i>Report,
86</i>). It was in consequence of this epidemic that the
Arikara abandoned their village lower down the Missouri
and removed to their present location near Fort Berthold,
North Dakota.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that for several years the Kiowa appear to have
been drifting eastward from their former haunts on the upper Arkansas.
Although no definite reason is assigned for this movement, it may have
been due to the influx of white men into Colorado, consequent upon the
discovery of gold at Pike's peak in 1858, which would have a tendency
to drive away the buffalo as well as to disquiet the Indians.</p>

<p><i>Ä´pätsä´t Sai</i>, "Treetop winter," or <i>Tséñko Sápän
Étpata Sai</i>, "Winter when horses ate ashes." This winter the Kiowa
camped on upper Walnut creek (<i>Tsodal-héñte-de P'a</i>, "No-arm's river"),
which enters the Arkansas at the Great Bend, in Kansas. There was
unusually deep snow upon the ground, so that the horses could not
get at the grass, and in their hunger tried to eat the ashes thrown out
from the camp fires.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>In the early spring a large war party, accompanied by women, as was
sometimes the custom among the Kiowa, started for Texas, along the
trail which runs south through the Panhandle, crossing the North Canadian
near Kiowa creek and passing on by Fort Elliott. While singing
the "travel song" on a southern head stream of Wolf creek the tree
tops returned the echo. The phenomenon was a mystery to the Indians,
who ascribed it to spirits, but it may have been due to the fact that
just south of the camp was a bluff, from which the sound may have been
echoed back. The figure over the winter mark is intended to indicate
the sound above the tree tops.</p>

<p>When a man wishes to gather a small war party he sends around to
invite those who may desire to join him. On the night before he
intends to start he sits alone in his tipi, having previously bent a long
stick, like a hoop, around the fire hole; then he begins the <i>Gua-dagya</i>
or travel song, beating time upon the hoop with another stick which
he holds in his hand. When those who intend going with him hear the
song, they come in one by one and join in it, beating
time in the same way with sticks. The women also come
in and sit behind the men, joining in the song with them,
but without beating time; after some time the leader
invites them to come outside, to a buffalo hide, which
the men surround and each holds it up with one hand
while they beat time upon it with the sticks. The
women and those who can not reach the hide stand behind
and all sing together. The song is sung at intervals
during the march. It has words with meaning and
is different from all their other songs; the first singing
by the leader is the signal that he intends to start the
next day; the pipe was sent around only for a very large
war party.</p>

<p>A contributor to the Montana Historical Society gives a
humorous account of a rawhide dance by a party of packers
on Columbia river, in 1858, when the tribes of that region had
combined against the whites. The account is of interest as showing
that the dance was found from the Columbia to the Rio Grande:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>About dark some seven or eight canoes loaded with Yakima warriors landed near
our camp. They were painted and rigged up in first-class war style and just spoiling
for a fight. Our few Indian packers and the interpreter took the situation in
and suggested that we bluff them. So we built a large camp fire out of sage brush
and greasewood, and all of us, the Major included, formed a circle, and with one
hand holding a rawhide, with a stick in the other, batted that rawhide and yelled
and danced until we were nearly exhausted. This act, the interpreter said, was
intended to show these Yakimas that we were not afraid of them and were ready to
give them "the best we had in the shop," and to my utter surprise when I turned
out in the morning not a canoe was to be seen. It was a complete bluff. They had
taken the hint and gone away during the night. I must confess I felt pleased, and
so would anyone, from the fact that there is less danger in thumping the rawhide
as a bluff than trying to dodge their bullets (<cite>Montana, 2</cite>).</p></blockquote>

at the Great Bend, a short distance below the
mouth of upper Walnut creek, called <i>Tsodalhéñte-de

Allison, who kept a trading store at its mouth, on the
east side, and who had lost his right arm from a
bullet received in a fight with his stepfather, whom
he killed in the encounter. From this circumstance
the Kiowa knew him as Tsodalhéñte, or sometimes
Man-héñk'ia, "Armless man" or "No-arm." He
had as partners his half brother, John Adkins,
known to the Kiowa as Kábodalte, "Left-handed,"
and another man named Booth. Fort Zarah was built in the immediate
vicinity of Allison's trading post in 1864.</p>

<p><i>Ä´sâhé K`ádó</i>, "Ragweed sun dance," so called because
held at a place where there was a large quantity of this
plant growing, at the junction of Medicine-lodge creek
and the Salt fork of the Arkansas, a short distance below
where the dances had been held in 1858 and 1862. On
the Set-t'an calendar the medicine lodge, instead of being
painted black, as usual, is blue-green, to show the color
of the plant (<i>ä´-sâhé</i>, literally "blue or green plant"), and is surmounted
by a blue-green stalk of <i>ä´-sâhé</i> or ragweed.</p>

<p>In this summer the Anko calendar records a fight between the Kiowa
tribe and soldiers, at which Anko himself was present. In the figure
the ragweed is indicated by irregular markings at the base of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
medicine pole, while the fight is represented in the conventional way
by means of bullets at the ends of wavy lines.</p>

<p>The encounter occurred at Port Larned, Kansas, called by the Kiowa
"The soldier place on Dark (i. e., shady)-timber (<i>ai-koñ</i>) river." The
Kiowa had camped outside the post and were holding a scalp dance
when Set-ängya and his cousin approached the entrance but were
warned away by the sentry. Not understanding his words, they continued
to advance, whereupon the soldier made a threatening motion
with his gun, as if about to shoot. Upon this Set-ängya discharged
two arrows at the soldier, shooting him through the body, while another
Kiowa fired at him with a pistol. A panic immediately ensued, the
Indians mounting their horses and the garrison hastily preparing to
resist an attack. It so happened that the soldiers' horses were grazing
outside the post and the Indians stampeded and ran them off, abandoning
their camp, the soldiers being unable to follow on foot. The
Indians did not risk an attack on the post, but remained
satisfied with the capture of the horses. No one was
hurt excepting the sentry. Whether his wound proved
fatal or not the Kiowa are unable to say. They state
that this was their first hostile encounter with United
States troops.</p>

<p>At the time of this occurrence there was a general
Indian war in progress on the plains. The encounter is
thus referred to by Agent Colley in a letter to the governor
of Colorado, dated July 26, 1864:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I last wrote you I was in hopes that our Indian troubles
were at an end. Colonel Chivington has just arrived from Larned
and gives a sad account of affairs at that post. They have killed
some ten men from a train and run off all the stock from the post.
As near as they can learn, all the tribes are engaged in it. The
colonel will give you the particulars. There is no dependence to be put in any of
them. I have done everything in my power to keep peace. I now think a little
powder and lead is the best food for them.</p></blockquote>

<p>In another place he states that "while the war chief of the Kiowa
tribe was in the commanding officer's quarters at Fort Larned, professing
the greatest friendship, the young men were running off nearly all
the horses, mules, and cattle at the post" (<cite>Report, 87</cite>).</p>

<h3 id="d1864_65">WINTER, 1864&mdash;65</h3>

<p><i>Tsenhó Sai</i>, "Muddy-traveling winter," so called because the mud
caused by the melting of heavy snows made traveling difficult. The
Kiowa and Apache, with a part of the Comanche, made their winter
camp on the South Canadian at <i>Gúădal-dóhá</i>, "Red bluff," on the
north side, between Adobe Walls and Mustang creek, in the Texas
panhandle. While here early in the winter they were attacked by the
famous scout Kit Carson, with a detachment of troops, assisted by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
number of the Ute and Jicarilla Apache. According to the Indian,
account, five persons of the allied tribes, including two women, were
killed. The others, after a brave resistance, finally abandoned their
camp, which was burned by the enemy. One of those killed was a
young Apache warrior who wore a war-bonnet. He was shot from his
horse and his war-bonnet was captured by a Ute warrior. An old
Apache warrior, who was left behind in his tipi in the hurry of flight,
was also killed.</p>

<p>In the Set-t'an calendar the attack upon the camp is indicated by
conventional bullets and arrows around two tipis above the winter
mark. In the Anko calendar it is indicated by a picture of the captured
war-bonnet.</p>

</div>

<p>According to the Kiowa statement, most of the younger men were
away on the warpath at the time, having left their families in the
winter camp in charge of the old chief Dohásän. Early one morning
some of the men had gone out to look for their ponies,
when they discovered the enemy creeping up to surround
them. They dashed back into camp and gave
the alarm, and the women, who were preparing breakfast,
hastily gathered up their children and ran, while
the men mounted their horses to repel the assault.
The Ute scouts advanced in Indian fashion, riding
about and keeping up a constant yelling to stampede
the Kiowa ponies, while the soldiers came on behind
quietly and in regular order. Stumbling-bear was
one of the leading warriors in the camp at the time
and distinguished himself in the defense, killing one
soldier and a Ute, and then killing or wounding
another soldier so that he fell from his horse. Another
warrior named Set-tádal, "Lean-bear," distinguished himself by his
bravery in singing the war song of his order, the <i>Toñkóñko</i>, as he
advanced to the charge, according to his military obligation, which
forbade him to save himself until he had killed an enemy. Sét-k`opte,
then a small boy, was there also, and describes vividly how he took his
younger brother by the hand, while his mother carried the baby upon
her back and another child in her arms, and all fled for a place of
safety while Stumbling-bear and the warriors kept off the attacking
party. The Kiowa escaped, excepting the five killed, but the camp
was destroyed.</p>

<p>The engagement is thus mentioned in the testimony of an army officer
a few months later:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I understand Kit Carson last winter destroyed an Indian village. He had about
four hundred men with him, but the Indians attacked him as bravely as any men in
the world, charging up to his lines, and he withdrew his command. They had a
regular bugler, who sounded the calls as well as they are sounded for troops. Carson
said if it had not been for his howitzers few would have been left to tell the tale.
This I learned from an officer who was in the fight (<cite>Condition, 1</cite>).</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>The engagement is described in detail by Lieutenant George H. Pettis,
who had charge of the two howitzers during the fight. The expedition,
which consisted of three hundred and thirty-five volunteer
soldiers and seventy-two Ute and Jicarilla Apache Indians, was under
command of Colonel Christopher ("Kit") Carson, the noted scout and
Indian fighter, then holding a commission in the First New Mexico
infantry. Starting from Fort Bascom, New Mexico, they proceeded
down the Canadian, the intention being to disable the Indians by taking
them by surprise in their winter camp, as Custer did on the Washita
four years later. The first village, a Kiowa camp consisting of one
hundred and seventy-six tipis, was discovered on the Canadian at the
entrance of a small stream since known as Kit Carson creek, in what
is now Hutchinson county, Texas, a short distance above Adobe Walls.
The attack was made at daybreak of November 25, 1864. After some
resistance the Kiowa retreated a few miles down the river, where there
were other camps of the allied Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche. Reenforced
from these, they returned and made such a desperate attack
upon the invaders that Carson was glad to retire after burning the
upper village, although the other camps against which the expedition
was directed were in plain sight below. The battle lasted all day, the
Indians disputing every foot of his advance and following up his
retreat so closely that only the howitzers saved the troops from utter
destruction.</p>

<p>In the early part of the engagement the soldiers corralled their horses
in an old abandoned adobe building which Pettis calls the Adobe Walls,
but which was probably the ruins of the trading post built by Bent
twenty years before (see winter <a href="#d1843_44">1843&mdash;44</a>). The Adobe Walls, where
Quanah led his celebrated fight, were not built until 1873 or 1874 and
were some distance down the river. Several white captives, women
and children, were in the hands of the Indians at the time of the attack,
but none of these was rescued. The Kiowa also saved all their horses,
although most of their winter provision and several hundred dressed
buffalo skins in the first village, together with the tipis, were destroyed
by the troops.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Quite a number of the enemy acted as skirmishers, being dismounted and hid in
the tall grass in our front, and made it hot for most of us by their excellent marksmanship,
while quite the larger part of them, mounted and covered with their war
dresses, charged continually across our front, from right to left and <i>vice versa</i>, about
200 yards from our line of skirmishers, yelling like demons, and firing from under the
necks of their horses at intervals. About 200 yards in rear of their line, all through
the fighting at the Adobe Walls, was stationed one of the enemy, who had a cavalry
bugle, and during the entire day he would blow the opposite call that was used by
the officer in our line of skirmishers; for instance, when our bugles sounded the
"advance," he would blow "retreat," and when ours sounded the "retreat," he
would follow with the "advance;" ours would signal "halt," he would follow suit.
So he kept it up all the day, blowing as shrill and clearly as our very best buglers.
Carson insisted that it was a white man, but I have never received any information
to corroborate this opinion (<i>Pettis</i>).</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p>It was most probably a Kiowa, possibly Set-t'aiñte himself, who was
famous for a bugle, which instrument he blew as a signal on state
occasions.</p>

<p>Deeming it unsafe to remain longer after destroying the first village,
Carson formed the troops in marching order, with skirmishers in front
and on the flanks and the howitzers bringing up the rear, and began
the return march.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The enemy was not disposed to allow us to return without molestation, and in a
very few minutes was attacking us on every side. By setting fire to the high, dry
grass of the river bottom, they drove us to the foothills, and by riding in rear of
the fire, as it came burning toward us, they would occasionally get within a few
yards of the column; being enveloped in the smoke, they would deliver the fire of
their rifles and get out of harm's way before they could be discovered by us.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the side of the troops, Pettis reports two soldiers killed and
twenty-one wounded, several mortally, together
with one Ute killed and four wounded. He puts
the Indian loss at nearly one hundred killed and
between one hundred and one hundred and fifty
wounded. The official report, which he quotes,
makes the number of tipis in the village destroyed
about one hundred and fifty and the Indian loss
in killed and wounded together only sixty. Among
these were four crippled or decrepit old Indians,
who were killed in the tipis by a couple of Ute
squaws searching for plunder. A buggy and
spring wagon belonging to Sierrito or "Little-mountain" (Dohásän) are
also mentioned as having been destroyed.</p>

<p>A signal instance of Indian bravery is noted by Pettis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At one of the discharges the shell passed directly through the body of a horse on
which was a Comanche riding at a full run, and went some 200 or 300 yards farther
on before it exploded. The horse, on being struck, went head foremost to earth,
throwing his rider, as it seemed, 20 feet into the air, with his hands and feet sprawling
in all directions, and as he struck the earth, apparently senseless, two other
Indians who were near by proceeded to him, one on each side, and throwing themselves
over on the sides of their horses, seized each an arm and dragged him from
the field between them, amid a shower of rifle balls from our skirmishers. This act
of the Indians in removing their dead and helpless wounded from the field is always
done, and more than a score of times were we eyewitnesses to this feat during the
afternoon (<i>Pettis</i>).</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Pihó K`ádó</i>, "Peninsula sun dance." It is so called because held

<p>The Anko calendar notes the death of the celebrated chief Dohásän,
"Little-bluff," the greatest and most noted chief in the history of the
tribe, who died on the Cimarron in this winter. The event is indicated
by the figure of a wagon, he being the only Kiowa who owned a wagon
at that time. For more than thirty years from the massacre
by the Osage in 1833, he had been the recognized
head chief of the Kiowa. His death left no one of sufficiently
commanding influence to unite the tribe under
one leadership, and thenceforth the councils of the Kiowa
were divided under such rival chieftains as Set-t'aiñte and
Kicking-bird until the unsuccessful outbreak of 1874
finally reduced them to the position of a reservation tribe
and practically put an end to the power of the chiefs.</p>

<p>This winter is notable also for the arrival of a large
trading party from Kansas under the leadership of a man
named John Smith. He traded also among the Cheyenne,
whose language he spoke, and was called by them
<i>Póomûts</i>, "Gray-blanket," or "Saddle-blanket," these articles
forming a part of his trading stock; this name the
Kiowa corrupted into <i>Pohóme</i>. The party visited all
the various camps of the Cheyenne and Kiowa, trading
blankets and other goods for buffalo hides. Smith died
among the Cheyenne after having lived more than forty
years in the Indian country, and was buried in the sand hills near
the present agency at Darlington, Oklahoma. His name appears in
the official reports as government interpreter for the Cheyenne, and
he rendered valuable assistance at the Medicine Lodge treaty in 1867.</p>

<p><i>Hâñ-kopédal K`ádó</i>, "Flat metal (i. e. German silver) sun dance,"
was held on Medicine-lodge creek, near its mouth, in Oklahoma. It was
so called because a trader brought them at this time a large quantity
of German silver, from which they made headdresses, belts for women,
bracelets, and other ornaments. German silver is known to the Kiowa
as "flat metal," because it is furnished to them in sheets, which they
cut and hammer into the desired shapes. On both calendars the event
is recorded in the same way, by the figure of a head pendent with
silver disks placed near the medicine lodge. Such pendants were
attached to the head of the scalplock, and consisted of a strip of
buffalo hide reaching nearly to the ground and covered along the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
length with a row of silver, copper, or German-silver disks, gradually
decreasing in size toward the bottom, which was usually finished
off with a tuft of bright-colored horsehair. They were called <i>góm-â´dal-hâ´ñgya</i>,
"back-hair-metal," and were highly
prized by the warriors. This was not the first time
the Kiowa had obtained German silver. In the
old days these ornaments were made for them, of
genuine silver, by Mexican silversmiths near the
present Silver City, New Mexico.</p>

<p>Charles W. Whitacre (or Whittaker), the trader
who brought their supply of metal on this occasion,
together with sugar and other goods, had some
knowledge of the Kiowa language, as well as of
Comanche and Caddo, and is familiarly known to
the older Kiowa as <i>Tsâli</i>, i. e., Charley. He was
present at the Medicine Lodge treaty the next year,

side of the Washita, near the place where the
Wichita school is now located, a short distance from the agency at

<p><i>Ä´pämâ´dal Ehótal-de Sai</i>, "Winter that Ä´pämâ'dalte was killed."
The name signifies "Struck-his-head-against-a-tree." The same event
is recorded on both calendars, the figures being sufficiently
suggestive. He was a Mexican captive among
the Kiowa, and was killed, in an encounter with troops
or Texans, while with a party led by the present Big-bow,
at a small creek on the main emigrant road to California
(<i>Hóan T'a`ká-i</i>, "White-man's road") in southwestern
Texas. When killed he was trying to stampede the
horses which the Texans had left a short distance away.
There is no official notice of this encounter in the reports,
beyond general references to continual Kiowa raids into
Texas.</p>

<p>In this winter, also, Andres Martinez, the most influential
captive among the Kiowa, was bought by them
from the Mescalero Apache, who had captured him a
few months previously near Las Vegas, New Mexico.
He was then seven years of age, and was adopted by
the Kiowa, and at once taken by them on a raid into
Mexico. His purchaser was Set-dayá-ite, "Many-bears,"
who was killed by the Ute in 1868.</p>

was in progress a party of Navaho stole a herd of Kiowa ponies, including
a fine white racer with black ears, the kind most highly prized by
the Indians. The Kiowa had no idea that the horses
had been stolen by lurking enemies, but supposed that
they had simply strayed, until after the dance was over,
when the three tribes organized an expedition against
the Navaho, at that time upon a reservation in eastern
New Mexico, and there captured a number of horses,
including the stolen herd. The event is recorded on the
Set-t'an calendar by means of the figure of a white horse
with black ears above the medicine lodge.</p>

<p><i>Ä´yä´daldä Sai</i>, "Timber-hill winter," so-called
on account of the famous treaty made this winter
with the confederated tribes on Medicine-lodge
creek, Kansas, known to the Kiowa as "<i>Ä´yä´daldä
P'a</i>, Timber-hill river." The picture on the Set-t'an
calendar is highly suggestive. It represents
a white man, who appears to be a soldier, grasping
the hand of an Indian, the locality being shown
by the figure of a tree-covered hill above the winter-mark.</p>

<p>The Anko calendar has no reference to this
treaty, which is the leading event in Kiowa history
of the last thirty years, but records instead
a minor occurrence, the killing by the Kiowa of a Navaho, indicated
below the winter mark by the figure of a man with his hair bunched in
Navaho fashion, wearing the characteristic black leggings and moccasins
and carrying a quiver. He was killed near <i>Gúădal Dóhá</i>, on the upper
South Canadian, by a party under White-horse, of which Anko was a
member. On examining the body of the dead man they found that he
had no ears, having probably been so born. For this reason the winter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
is sometimes known as <i>T'á-bódal Ehótal-de Sai</i>, "Winter that Spoiled-ear
was killed." Several parties went against the Navaho on the Pecos
this year (that tribe being still at the Bosque Redondo), particularly a
large expedition, including nearly all the Comanche and about half of
the Kiowa and Apache, which started immediately after the sun dance,
defeated the Navaho in an important engagement, and returned in
time for the treaty.</p>

<p>The treaty of Medicine Lodge has already been discussed at length
in another place. According to the statement of the Kiowa they were
camped on the creek where they had held their sun dance, when they
were summoned to Fort Larned. Set-t'aiñte, Set-ängya, Set-ĭmkía, and
the other chiefs, with all their people, at once moved to that point,
where they met an officer who, they say, was called <i>Gánúän</i>, "General"
by the whites, and whom the Indians called <i>Pasót-kyä'tó</i>, "Old-man-of-the-thunder,"
because he wore upon his shoulders the eagle or thunderbird.
This was General Winfield S. Hancock, then in command in that
section. By his direction they camped on the river near the post, where
they were supplied with rations for some days until the purpose of the
government was explained to them. They then returned to Medicine-lodge
creek and prepared a council house among the trees, ready for
the arrival of the commissioners. The medicine lodge and Kiowa
camp were on the south (west) side of the creek, while the council house
in which the treaty was made was on the opposite (northeast) side, 12
miles above, or about 3 miles above the junction of Elm creek and
near the present site of Medicine Lodge, Barber county, Kansas. It is
described in the treaty itself as "the council camp on Medicine Lodge
creek, 70 miles south of Fort Larned, in the State of Kansas." The low,
timbered hill, from which the stream takes its Kiowa name of <i>Ä'yä'daldä
P'a</i>, "Timber-hill river," is on the east side, opposite the medicine lodge
of the last preceding dance, from which the stream derives its present
name. It was a favorite dance headquarters, as several other dances
had already been held in the same vicinity.</p>

<p>The Kiowa say that the white man, Philip McCusker, who interpreted
the treaty to the three confederated tribes, spoke only Comanche,
and his words were translated into Kiowa by Bä'o ("Cat"), alias
Guñsádalte, "Having-horns," who is still living. They sum up the
provisions of the treaty by saying that the commissioners promised to
give them "a place to go," to give them schools, and to feed them for
thirty years, and hoped that they would then know how to take care of
themselves. Only a part of the Comanche were represented, most of
the Kwáhadi band being then on an expedition against the Navaho.
According to contemporary notices, there were present at the treaty over
eight hundred and fifty tipis, or about five thousand souls, of the Cheyenne,
Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, together with about
six hundred whites, including the commissioners and attachés, a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
detachment of the Seventh infantry, and miscellaneous camp followers,
the various groups and bands being scattered for a distance of several
miles along the stream, forming probably the largest Indian gathering
that had ever been held on the plains.</p>

<i>Ä'yädaldä P'a K'ádó</i>, "Timber-hill river (Medicine-lodge creek) sun
dance." The dance this summer was held on Medicine-lodge creek,
near where the treaty had been made, this, as has been said, being a
favorite place for the purpose. The Cheyenne and Arapaho also frequently
held their sun dance in the same neighborhood, but not in connection
with the Kiowa, although they always attended the Kiowa
dance in large numbers. The Comanche had no sun dance of their own,
but sometimes joined with the Kiowa. On one occasion
they tried to get up such a dance, but the attempt was
a failure.</p>

<p class="hang2"><small><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 143&mdash;Summer 1868&mdash;Ute fight.</small></p>
</div>

<p>This summer was signalized by a disastrous encounter
with the Ute, in which two of the three <i>taímes</i> of the
Kiowa were captured. On the Set-t'an calendar this
battle is indicated by the figure, above the medicine
lodge, of a man holding out the red stone war-pipe,
which was sent around as an invitation to the warriors
to join the expedition. On the Anko calendar it is indicated
by flying bullets about the medicine lodge.</p>

<p>This battle was the most disastrous in the history of
the Kiowa tribe since the memorable massacre by the
Osage in 1833. The impression made was perhaps even
greater, for the reason that their sacred palladium captured
on this occasion has never since been recovered.</p>

<p>In the previous winter Pá-tadal, "Lean-bull" (alias Poor-buffalo),
who is still living, had led a small party against the Navaho beyond
the head of the South Canadian. On reaching the salt beds on that
river, near the line between Texas and New Mexico, they met some
Navaho coming on foot to steal Kiowa horses. A fight ensued, resulting
in the death of one Navaho and one Kiowa, the latter being Pá-tadal's
stepson. The father thirsted for revenge, and at the next sun dance he
sent around the pipe to all the warriors of the tribe to enlist them for a
great expedition against the Navaho. A large number responded,
perhaps two hundred, including some of the Comanche, and placed themselves
under his leadership. Among these was Set-dayá-ite, "Many-bears,"
the son (nephew?) of Ansó'te, the medicine keeper. To render
victory more certain and complete, he asked and obtained permission
from his father to carry with the expedition the two smaller <i>taíme</i>
images, viz, the small "man" figure and the "bear kidney." These
were sometimes carried to the field, but the larger one, the "woman,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
which the tribe still retains, was never allowed to leave the home camp.
Set-dayá-ite carried one and intrusted the other to his friend
Pá-guñhéñte, "Hornless-bull." According to another story, Pá-guñhéñte's
medicine was one which belonged to himself and had no connection
with the <i>taíme</i>, although it was a smaller image of similar
appearance. However, Pá-guñhéñte was killed and his medicine
captured, together with the other.</p>

<p>They set out for the Navaho country, but the omens were unpropitious
from the start. Among the numerous things tabooed to the
<i>taíme</i> are bears, skunks, rabbits, and looking-glasses, none of which
must be permitted to come near the sacred image or be touched by the
taíme keeper. Almost at the start the warriors were alarmed by seeing
a skunk cross their path, and soon afterward it was discovered that
the Comanche had brought with them their looking-glasses, which they
refused to break or throw away, but wrapped them up and concealed
them at one of the camping places to await their return. Farther on,
at a place where the warriors had halted for the night to prepare supper,
the wind carried to the nostrils of the Kiowa the smell of burning
grease. On investigating the cause they found that their sacrilegious
allies had killed a bear and were broiling the flesh over their fire.
Realizing that nothing but defeat could now be in store for them, many
of the warriors turned back, but Set-dayá-ite, trusting to his medicine,
persisted in going forward, while Pá-tadal, although he foresaw disaster,
as the organizer and leader of the expedition felt bound in honor to
proceed.</p>

<p>They went up the north bank of the South Canadian until they
reached the salt beds in the vicinity of Red-river spring, near where
they had encountered the Navaho the preceding winter. Here they
met a much smaller party of Ute, said to have numbered only thirty or
forty, and the battle at once began. For some reason, perhaps because
the Kiowa felt that their gods had deserted them, they did not fight
with their accustomed dash, and the battle soon became a flight, the
Ute pursuing them for some miles down the river and killing seven,
including Set-dayá-ite and his adopted son, a Mexican captive. Set-dayá-ite
on this occasion rode a balky horse, which became unmanageable,
so that he dismounted and met his fate on foot, telling his
comrades that there was his place to die. His adopted son might have
saved himself, but on seeing his father's plight he returned and was
killed with him. Pá-guñhéñte, who carried the other medicine, was
also among the slain.</p>

<p>Set-dayá-ite had the <i>taíme</i> bag tied upon his back, where it was
found by the Ute after the fight. They readily recognized it as some
great "medicine," a conjecture which was made certain if it be true, as
some say, that the dead man had cut (painted?) upon his body sacred
emblems similar to those painted upon the image itself, viz, a crescent
upon each breast, the sun in the center, and upon his forehead another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
crescent. Stumbling-bear, who was in the fight, as was also Anko,
went back shortly afterward to bury his remains. He found a beaten
circle around the skeleton of Set-dayá-ite, as though the Ute had
danced around his dead body.</p>

<p>The Ute carried the <i>taíme</i> with them to their own country, but misfortune
went with it. The son of its capturer was shortly afterward
killed in a fight with the Cheyenne, and soon after that the custodian
himself was killed by a stroke of lightning. Afraid to keep longer
such "bad medicine," they brought both images down to the trader
Maxwell, in New Mexico, who placed them on a shelf in his store, where
they remained in plain view for a long time, but were finally lost. The
Ute left word with Maxwell that the Kiowa, if they came for the images,
might have them, on payment of a specified number of ponies. For
some reason the Kiowa did not come&mdash;perhaps because they were afraid
to trust themselves so far in their enemies' country.</p>

<p>While the sacred images were on Maxwell's shelf they were seen by
a brother of George Bent, of the noted pioneer trading family, from
whom the author obtained a description of their appearance. They
were two small carved stones or petrifactions, the <i>taíme</i> proper having
the shape of a man's head and bust, and was decorated and painted.
The other resembled in form a bear's kidney. While in New Mexico
some years ago the author made diligent inquiry among Maxwell's former
business associates concerning the images, but found no one who could
throw any light upon their whereabouts. In 1893 Big-bow and some
others of the tribe visited the Ute, chiefly for the purpose of ascertaining
the fate of the <i>taíme</i>, not knowing that it had passed out of their
possession. They learned nothing, however, as they asked no direct
questions concerning it and the Ute volunteered no information. This
was the first friendly meeting between the two tribes, although as early
as 1873 the Kiowa chiefs in council had made an urgent request to the
agent that some good white man should be sent with them to make
peace with the Ute (<cite>Battey, 18</cite>).</p>

<p>When the news of the defeat reached them, the Kiowa were encamped
on the Arkansas, near Fort Larned, where at that time they drew their
government issues. They at once moved down to the Washita and
encamped adjoining the Cheyenne village under Black-kettle, on the
western border of Oklahoma. This village was soon after destroyed by
Custer. About this time steps were taken to confine the confederated
tribes to the reservation assigned them by the late treaty, which was
soon after accomplished, and as a people the Kiowa never again went
back to the neighborhood of Arkansas river.</p>

<p>The only official reference to this fight, if indeed it does refer to it, is
the incidental mention in a letter of about June 20 that an appointment
by the agent for the Ute and Jicarilla Apache had been postponed
in consequence of the absence of Kaneatche, who was away and had
had a fight with the Kiowa and Comanche (<cite>Report, 88</cite>). Kaneatche,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
Kanache, or Conyatz (<i>Kanats</i> according to Major Powell) was the
head chief of the confederate Ute and Jicarilla band of Apache, and
on his death was succeeded by Ouray.</p>

<p>The encounter is thus noted by a contemporary author:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>During the previous summer [1868] a war party of Ute left their haunts in New
Mexico, and after marching on foot a distance of over 500 miles fell upon a band of
Kiowa, completely routed them, captured a number of ponies, took many scalps,
and, more calamitous than all, got possession of the "medicine" of the band. As
might be inferred, the Kiowa had a superstitious dread of the very name Ute
(<cite>Keim, 2</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The action and the grief of the Kiowa over the loss of their medicine
are further described by a writer in a contemporary Kansas newspaper,
who evidently speaks with exact knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>About the 10th of July [1868] the Kiowa had a battle with the Ute, in which the
chief Heap-of-Bears and seven other Kiowa braves were killed. Heap-of-Bears had
on his person the medicine of the Kiowa, which was captured by
the Ute, who still retain it. This medicine consists of an image
about 18 inches in length, carved to represent a human face, and
covered with the down and feathers of the eagle and other birds
and swathed in wrappers of different materials of value. Although
I have been conversant with Indian habits and customs for a long
time, I was surprised to find the value these people attach to this
medicine. They begged and implored Colonel Murphy to recover
it for them, and promised to pay the Ute as many horses as they
wanted, and also to make a permanent and lasting peace, not only
with the Ute, but also to refrain from further depredations on the
Texas border, if this should be restored. Colonel Murphy promised
to endeavor to recover it, but I think his success in the matter will
be doubtful, as the Ute also attach great importance to their capture,
believing that while they retain it the Kiowa will be powerless to do
them harm (<cite>Abbott, 1</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Tän-gúădal Ehótal-de Sai</i>, "Winter that Tän-gúădal was
killed." <i>Tän</i> is the name of a particular variety of headdress,
also of an edible root resembling a turnip; <i>gúădal</i>
signifies red. Shortly after the removal to the Washita,
a small raiding party went to Texas. In an encounter with a white
man and boy both parties fired simultaneously and Tän-gúădal was
killed. Although a young man, he was a noted warrior and the hereditary
owner of a medicine lance or <i>zebat</i>, shaped and adorned like an
arrow. The event is indicated on the Set-t'an calendar by the figure,
above the winter mark, of a man holding the arrow lance. On the
Anko calendar it is indicated by the rude figure of the medicine lance.</p>

<p>This medicine lance, which was hereditary in Tän-gúădal's family,
came originally from the Crows. The one carried by him on this occasion,
as described by Set-k`opte, who was with the party, had a Mexican-made
steel blade and was left sticking upright in the ground at the
place where they rested before the encounter, the owner not having
taken it into the fight. Set-t'aiñte claimed the hereditary right to this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
medicine lance, through marriage into the family of one of Tän-gúădal's
ancestors. Despite the protest of Tän-gúădal, he made a similar lance,
which he carried for several years (see summer <a href="#d1874">1874</a>). This lance of
Set-t'aiñte is said to have had a separable ornamented wooden point,
which was inserted on ceremonial occasions, while an ordinary steel
blade was substituted when it was to be used in actual
service. Similar "medicine" lances for ceremonial
purposes were used also among other tribes.</p>

<p>The dance was held on the north side of the North
fork of Red River, a short distance below the junction of Sweetwater
creek, near the western line of Oklahoma, the Kiowa having been
removed during the preceding autumn from Kansas and the north to
their present reservation, but still ranging outside the boundaries, under
the hunting privilege accorded by the late treaty. While the dance was
in progress, Big-bow, who had gone with a large party against the Ute
to avenge the death of Set-dayá-ite the year before, returned
with the war-bonnet of a Ute whom he had killed
in the mountains at the head of the Arkansas, in Colorado.
By a curious chance this Ute was one whom the Cheyenne
or Arapaho had wounded and scalped on a former expedition.
The Ute had taken their wounded comrade to
the Mexicans of New Mexico, who cured him, only to die
soon afterward by the hand of a Kiowa. The facts in the
case were learned by Big-bow on his friendly visit to the
Ute in 1893.</p>

<p>This was a winter of chronic alarm, as the Cheyenne, the neighbors
and friends of the Kiowa, were on the warpath and were being hard
pressed by Custer. The Kiowa had made their winter settlement in
two camps on Beaver creek, near the junction of Wolf creek, in the
vicinity of the present Fort Supply, in Oklahoma. It was reported
that soldiers were in the neighborhood, and a party of young men went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
out to look for them. On returning, about daylight, one of them, who
carried a bugle, blew it to announce their approach, with the result
that the whole camp, thinking that the troops were about to attack
them, fled precipitately several miles before the truth was discovered.</p>

the last, was held on the North fork of Red river,
but on the south side, in what is now Greer county,
Oklahoma, near where the reservation line strikes the stream. During
the dance the traders brought corn and watermelons to sell to the
Indians. The seeds were thrown away, and on returning to the spot
in the fall the Kiowa found that they had germinated in the sandy soil
and developed into full growth; hence the common name of the dance,
indicated on the Set-t'an calendar by a stalk of green (blue) corn beside
the medicine lodge. On the Anko calendar it is distinguished
as the "Dusty sun dance," on account of the
high winds which raised clouds of dust during the dance

home of the bones of young Set-ängya, indicated by a
skeleton above the winter mark, with a sitting bear over
the head.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1870, before the last sun dance, the son
of the noted chief Set-ängya ("Sitting-bear"), the young
man having the same name as his father, had made a raid
with a few followers into Texas, where, while making an
attack upon a house, he had been shot and killed. After
the dance his father with some friends went to Texas, found
his bones and wrapped them in several fine blankets, put
the bundle upon the back of a led horse and brought them home. On
the return journey he killed and scalped a white man, which revenge
served in some measure to assuage his grief. On reaching home he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
erected a tipi with a raised platform inside, upon which, as upon a bed,
he placed the bundle containing his son's bones. He then made a feast
within the funeral tipi, to which he invited all his friends in the name
of his son, telling them, "My son calls you to eat." From that time
he always spoke of his son as sleeping, not as dead, and frequently put
food and water near the platform for his refreshment on awaking. While
on a march the remains were always put upon the saddle of a led horse,
as when first brought home, the tipi and the horse thus burdened
being a matter of personal knowledge to all the middle-age people of
the tribe now living. He continued to care for his son's bones in this
manner until he himself was killed at Fort Sill about a year later, when
the Kiowa buried them. Although a young man, Set-ängya's son held
the office of <i>Toñhyópdă´</i>, the pipe-bearer or leader who went in front
of the young warriors on a war expedition.</p>

</div>

<p>The Anko calendar records two incidents. The first was a drunken
fight between two Kiowa, in which one killed the other, indicated by
the rude representation of two heads with a bottle
between them. The other event was the killing of four
or five negroes in Texas by a party led by Mamä´nte
("Walking-above)," who brought back the scalps with
the woolly-hair attached. It is shown on the calendar
by means of a figure with bullet and arrow wounds, drawn
below the heads and the bottle. An attempt has been
made to indicate the peculiar woolly hair of the negro;
the trousers are blue, like those worn by soldiers, Anko
thinking they were probably soldiers, because, as he
says, "Negroes can't go alone."</p>

<p>In this winter Ansó-gíăni or Ansó`te, "Long-foot," the great medicine
keeper, died of extreme old age. He had been in charge of the
<i>taíme</i> for forty years; consequently there was no sun dance for two
years until his successor was selected.</p>

<h3 id="d1871">SUMMER 1871</h3>

<p>For this summer the Anko calendar records the death of Koñpä´te,
"Blackens-himself," who was shot through the head in a skirmish
with soldiers. He was the brother of the noted raider, White-horse.
The event is indicated by the rude representation of a head struck by
a bullet. As there was no dance this summer, the medicine lodge is
not represented on either calendar.</p>

<p>The great event of the summer was the arrest of the noted chiefs
and raiders, Set-t'aiñte, Set-äñgya and Ä´do-eétte, "Big-tree." The
figure on the Set-t'an calendar shows the soldier arresting Set-t'aiñte,
distinguished by the red war-paint which he always used.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the promises of good conduct which had induced
General Sheridan to release Lone-wolf and Set-t'aiñte when the tribe
had been brought to the reservation in December, 1868, the Kiowa
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
had never ceased their raids into Texas, and had constantly behaved
in the most insolent manner toward the agent and military commander
on the reservation. On May 17, 1871, a party of about one hundred
warriors, led by Set-t'aiñte and Set-ängya, attacked a wagon train in
Texas, killed 7 men and captured 41 mules. Shortly afterward Set-t'aiñte
had the boldness to avow the deed to the agent, Lawrie Tatum,
who at once called upon the commander at Fort Sill to arrest Set-t´aiñte
and several other chiefs who had accompanied him, viz:
Set-ängya, Big-tree, Big-bow, Eagle-Heart and Fast-bear. The officer
promptly responded and arrested the first three; Eagle-heart escaped
and the other two were absent at the time. On May 28, the three
prisoners were sent under military guard to Fort Richardson (Jacksboro),
Texas, to be tried for their crimes, when Set-ängya attacked the
guard and was killed in the wagon (<cite>Report, 89</cite>; <cite>Record, 11</cite>; <i>Battey,
19</i>; <i>Tatum letter</i>). The fate of the other prisoners is noted elsewhere.</p>

<p>According to the Kiowa account, which is correct in the main incidents,
the prisoners having been disarmed, Set-ängya was placed in a
wagon, accompanied by a single soldier, and Set-t'aiñte and Big-tree
were put into another wagon with other guards, and an escort of cavalry
and Tonkawa scouts rode on either side. Leaving Fort Sill, they
started toward the south on the road to Texas, when Set-ängya began a
loud harangue to the two prisoners in the other wagon, telling them
that he was a chief and a warrior, too old to be treated like a little
child. Then pointing to a tree where the road descends to cross a small
stream about a mile south of the post, he said: "I shall never go beyond
that tree." As he spoke in the Kiowa language, none but the prisoners
knew what he was saying. Then raising his voice, he sang his death
song, the song of the Kâitséñko, of whom he was chief:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I´ha hyo´ o´ya i´ya´ i´ya' o i´ha ya´ya yo´yo´</span>
<span class="i0">A´he´ya ahe´ya´ ya´he´yo´ ya e´ya he´yo e´he´yo</span>
<span class="i0">Kâ´itseñ´ko änä´obahe´ma haa´-ipai´-degi o´ba´-ikă´</span>
<span class="i0">Kâi´tse´ñko änä´obahe´ma hadâ´mga´gi o´ba´-ikă´</span>
<span class="i0"><i>I hahyo, etc.</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Aheya, etc.</i></span>
<span class="i0">O sun, you remain forever, but we Kâitse´ñko must die.</span>
<span class="i0">O earth, you remain forever, but we Kâitse´ñko must die.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The song ended, he suddenly sprang upon the guard with a knife
which he had managed to conceal about his person, and had cut him
seriously when the soldiers following behind fired and he fell dead in
the wagon. He was buried in the military cemetery at Fort Sill, but
there is nothing to distinguish the grave. The Kiowa statement of his
singing his death song is corroborated by Battey and by agent Tatum.</p>

<p>Although a noted warrior and a chief of the Kâitséñko, Set-ängya was
generally feared and disliked by the tribe on account of his vindictive
disposition and his supposed powers of magic. It was believed that he
could kill an enemy by occult means, and that he had in this manner
actually disposed of one or two who had incurred his displeasure. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
knife with which he attacked the soldier is reputed to have been a
"medicine knife," which he could swallow and disgorge as demanded
by the necessity of concealment or use; several stories are told by the
Indians to confirm this belief. His paternal grandmother was a woman
of the Sarsi (<i>Pákiägo</i>, a small tribe incorporated with the Blackfeet,)
who had married a Kiowa when the latter tribe lived in the far north.
Unlike Indians generally, he habitually wore a mustache and straggling
beard. He left two children; the elder, a son, was adopted into a white
family under the name of Joshua Given, was educated in the east, married
a white lady, afterward returned as a missionary to his people,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
and died of consumption about four years ago. The younger child,
Julia Given, was until recently employed in one of the mission schools
on the reservation.</p>

<p class="caption">LAWRIE TATUM, FIRST KIOWA AGENT, WITH GROUP OF RESCUED CAPTIVES.</p>
</div>

<p>Bearing on the subject of the arrest of the three chiefs and the
death of Set-ängya, we quote at length from a letter written by Lawrie
Tatum, the first agent for the Kiowa and associated tribes, from whom
the author has obtained much valuable information in response to letters
of inquiry. Mr Tatum, who is now (1896) living in Springdale,
Iowa, at the advanced age of 75 years, is a member of the Society of
Friends, and was appointed, on their recommendation, in accordance
with the "Indian peace policy" of President Grant, soon after the
tribes were brought upon the reservation. He took charge, as he
states, July 1, 1869, and resigned March 31, 1873, in consequence of the
release of Set-t'aiñte and Big-tree, a measure which he opposed, as it
was on his motion that these men were originally arrested. During his
incumbency he rescued a number of white captives without ransom&mdash;a
thing before unexampled. On this point he states, in a letter of
March 31, 1896:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I recovered fourteen white captives from the Indians, two of whom had forgotten
their names and every word of English. I advertised for their parents and found
them. I also recovered twelve Mexicans. I was the first agent, I think, that those
Indians had, who obtained captives of them without paying a ransom. A part of
them were procured by withholding rations from the band that had them, and a part
were obtained by means of the leverage that Colonel Mackenzie gave by taking a
hundred women and children from a raiding camp to Texas.</p></blockquote>

<p>His stringent measures at times brought him into disfavor with his
co-religionists, but had great influence in bringing these unruly tribes
under effectual control. He writes, under date of April 7, 1896:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>General Sherman called at my office, Kiowa and Comanche agency, Indian Territory,
fifth month, 23, 1871, to see if I knew of any Indians having gone to Texas
lately. He said that a party of Indians, supposed to number about one hundred and
fifty, had attacked a train of ten wagons about 17 miles from Fort Richardson and
killed the trainmaster and six teamsters. Five others escaped. Being at the fort
at the time, he gave orders for the available troops to follow them with thirty days'
rations and report at Fort Sill.</p>

<p>I told the general that I could not then tell what Indians they were, but thought
that I could ascertain in a few days. Four days later the Indians came after their
rations. Before issuing I asked the chiefs to come into the office, and told them of
the tragedy in Texas, and wished to know if they could tell by what Indians it had
been committed. Satanta immediately arose and said:</p>

<p>"Yes; I led in that raid. I have been told that you have stolen a large amount of
our annuity goods and given them to the Texans. I have repeatedly asked for arms
and ammunition, which have not been furnished, and made other requests which
have not been granted. You do not listen to my talk. The white people are preparing
to build a railroad through our country, which will not be permitted. Some
years ago they took us by the hair and pulled us here close to Texas, where we have
to fight them. When General Custer was here some years ago he arrested me and
kept me in confinement several days, but that is played out now. There are never
to be any more Kiowa Indians arrested. I want you to remember that.</p>

<p>"On account of these grievances a short time ago I took about one hundred of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
my warriors, whom I wished to teach how to fight, to Texas, with the chiefs Satank
[<i>Set-ängya</i>], Eagle-heart, Big-tree, Big-bow, and Fast-bear. We found a mule train,
which we captured, and killed seven of the men. Three of our men got killed, but
we are willing to call it even. It is all over now, and not necessary to say much
more about it. We don't expect to do any raiding around here this summer. If
any other Indian claims the honor of leading that party he will be lying to you, for
I led it myself."</p>

<p>Satank, Eagle-heart, and Big-tree were present, and assented to the correctness of
the statement made by Satanta. That they were guilty of murder in the first degree
I had not the shadow of a doubt, and thought that forbearance in the case had ceased
to be a virtue and would become a crime. I told the men to go to issuing and I
would go to the fort (Sill). I went to Colonel Grierson's quarters and requested
him to arrest Satanta, Satank, Eagle-heart, Big-tree, Big-bow, and Fast-bear on the
charge of murder. Scarcely had the order been given when, to the surprise of all of
of us, Satanta took the post interpreter into Colonel Grierson's quarters. He had
heard that there was a big Washington chief there (General Sherman), and he
probably wished to measure up with him and see how they compared. When I
started to the agency he said he would go with me, but some soldiers stepped in front
of him with their revolvers and ordered him back, and he quietly obeyed. The
colonel sent for Satank and Eagle-heart to go to his quarters. Satank went and
was arrested. Eagle-heart got nearly there and saw Big-tree being arrested, and he
turned and fled. Kicking-bird pled eloquently for the release of the three prisoners,
although he entirely disapproved of their raiding.</p>

<p>A day or two after the arrest, Colonel Mackenzie, in command of the troops from
Fort Richardson, arrived at Fort Sill and reported that the heavy and continued
rains had obliterated the tracks of the raiding Indians so that they could not be
followed. After remaining a few days, the colonel with his troops took charge of
the prisoners to convey them to Texas for trial. Satank was so refractory that he
was put into a wagon with two soldiers, and Satanta and Big-tree were put into
another wagon. George Washington, a Caddo Indian, rode alongside of the wagons
as they left Fort Sill. Satank called to him and said: "I wish to send a little
message by you to my people. Tell them that I am dead. I died the first day out,
and my bones will be lying on the side of the road. I wish my people to gather
them up and take them home." Satanta also sent a message, saying: "Tell my
people to take the forty-one mules that we stole from Texas to the agent, as he and
Colonel Grierson require. Don't commit any depredations around Fort Sill or
in Texas."</p>

<p>When about a mile from the post Satank sang his death song, and with his back
to the guard drew the shackles off his hands by taking some of the skin with them.
Then with a butcher knife which he had secreted, he started for the guard in the
front part of the wagon, cutting one of the soldiers slightly in the leg. They both
jumped out, leaving their guns. Satank picked up one of them and commenced
loading it, wanting to kill one more man. Before he got it loaded he received
several shots, and in twenty minutes died in much agony, gritting his teeth. Colonel
Grierson had him buried at Fort Sill. He gave the Indians permission to take him up
and convey him to their camp for interment, which they declined to do.</p>

<p>Mr Leeper, my interpreter, who has since been a practicing physician in Chicago,
and Horace P. Jones, the post interpreter, attended the trial of Satanta and Big-tree
at Jacksboro. The jury brought in a verdict of murder in the first degree, and sentenced
them to be hung on the 1st of the following September. I had requested
that they be not executed, and gave my reasons for thinking that such a course would
have a better effect upon the Indians of the reservation. The judge wrote me that
he approved of my request and would ask the governor to commute the sentence to
life imprisonment, which was done. The Kiowas delivered to me the stolen mules,
as Satanta requested.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<p>Although Set-ängya was a bad Indian and deserved punishment, it
is impossible not to admire the grim courage of the old man, as, true
to his warrior oath to despise death, though laden with chains and
surrounded by armed troops, he boldly sang his death song, and then,
wrenching the manacles from his bleeding wrists, drove the guards
from the wagon, picked up their abandoned guns, and coolly prepared
to kill one more enemy of his race before he fell, shot to death.</p>

<h3 id="d1871_72">WINTER 1871&mdash;72 (1872&mdash;73)</h3>

<p>A part of the Kiowa camped during this winter on <i>Ä´-gíăni P'a</i>,
"Long-tree creek," a branch of Elk creek of upper Red river. The
name is indicated on the Anko calendar by the figure of a tree below
the winter mark. The remainder of the tribe camped on the Washita,
near Rainy mountain. During this winter the Kiowa
were visited by a large party of Pawnee, who came to
make peace. They came on foot and remained a long
time, returning with many horses given them by their
hosts. On the Set-t'an calendar the event is indicated
by a representation of three characteristic Pawnee heads
above the winter mark.</p>

<p class="hang2"><small><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 151&mdash;Winter 1871&mdash;72 (1872&mdash;73)&mdash;Pawnee visit; camp on Long-tree creek.</small></p>
</div>

<p>This was the first friendly meeting within the memory
of the two tribes. The Pawnee first came to the
Wichita, their near relatives, and then announced their
intention to visit the Kiowa to make a treaty of peace.
The Kiowa debated the matter for some time, but finally
agreed, and after the visit dismissed their guests with
many presents of horses. The older men describe the
identical horses which were given. In the fall of 1873
another large party of the Pawnee visited the Wichita
and remained some time. On their return home they
gave such an account of their experience that the
entire tribe decided to remove to the south from
Nebraska, where they were constantly harassed by the Dakota. The
matter was brought to the attention of the government and a new
reservation was selected for them in Indian Territory (Oklahoma), to
which they removed in the spring of 1875 (<cite>Report, 90</cite>).</p>

<p>From the concurrent notices by Battey, Grinnell, and the Indian
Commissioner, together with the statements of a number of Indians,
it is plain that in this instance the author of the calendar has made
an error in the date, which should be the winter of 1872&mdash;73. As the
Indians tell it, the Pawnee came late in the fall, after the Kiowa
had left <i>Ä´gíăni P'a</i>. The explanation may be in a confusion
between the visit of the Pawnee and that of the Pueblos (see winter
<a href="#d1872_73">1872&mdash;73</a>).</p>

<p>In regard to this Pawnee visit, which led to the removal of the tribe
to Indian Territory, Grinnell says that in the summer of 1870 Lone-chief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
led a large party of the Pawnee southward to visit the Wichita.
Again in the winter of 1871&mdash;72, the same chief, with a party, started
on another visit to the Wichita, but for some reason turned back. The
next winter (1872&mdash;73) in consequence of renewed inroads of the Dakota,
the Pawnee were thrown into an unsettled condition and the question
of removal to a safer situation began to be seriously discussed. It was
finally decided to send a small party under Lone-chief and one or two
others to the southern tribes to learn how these would look upon
a general Pawnee migration into Indian Territory. The delegates
visited the Oto, Kansa, Wichita, Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache, and
were everywhere received in a friendly manner. The Pawnee then
invited the chiefs of the various tribes to meet them at the Wichita
camp, where the Pawnee speaker broached the proposition, stating
that his people wished to be at peace and had made up their minds to
come and live with their friends in the south.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They received a cordial invitation from all the chiefs of the different tribes, who
said that they had good land and plenty of buffalo for them, and the result was that
in 1873 the first party moved south and was followed by others, until in 1875 the
whole tribe had removed from Nebraska to the Indian Territory (<cite>Grinnell, Pawnee, 1</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Grinnell is not entirely consistent with himself, but in another place
says that the first expedition under Lone-chief took place "the following
summer in August" of 1869 or 1870, and that it was on that occasion
that the Pawnee visited and made peace with the Kiowa, and
afterward visited the Comanche (<cite>Grinnell, Pawnee, 2</cite>).</p>

<p>The Quaker teacher, Battey, was with Kicking-bird in the Kiowa
camp on Cache creek on the arrival of the Pawnee dancers, numbering
forty-five, in March, 1873. He gives an extended account of their
reception and performance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A party of Pawnees came in last evening, giving notice of their arrival by their
headman and two or three others coming into camp, while the main body remained
2 or 3 miles distant. This morning a public reception was given them.</p>

<p>The party was seen coming over a ridge in single file, bearing a white flag.
Approaching to within 20 rods, they planted their flag, upon which was painted the
single letter P, and sat down in a line on each side of it, facing the village. After
sitting in this manner for perhaps half an hour, during which they maintained entire
silence, and preliminary arrangements for their reception were made in the camp,
the chiefs, followed by most of the headmen, and these by the young men, women,
and children, went forth to welcome them. Upon drawing near to them, the Kiowa
chiefs walking with a slow step and dignified mien, some of the old women set up a
chant in a shrill voice, whereupon the head chief of the Pawnees and two or three
others, perhaps the nearest in rank, arose, and with a quick, firm step approached
the Kiowa chiefs, and after embracing them retired to their former position.</p>

<p>Others of the Pawnees came forward, a few at a time, until all had embraced and
been embraced by the Kiowa chiefs and headmen. The women, remaining some
distance behind, renewed their shrill chant from time to time. Some of the Pawnees
occasionally placed a shawl or embroidered blanket upon the shoulders of a Kiowa,
while several of the old men passed along in front of the whole line of the visitors,
shaking hands with them. After this the Pawnees set up a weird song, during the
continuance of which Kiowa fathers, each carrying a small child in his arms, bearing
a piece of stick in its little hands, young girls, and occasionally a woman, would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
approach the Pawnees, and selecting someone, would present themselves before
him, holding out the stick. Thereupon he would arise, place his hands upon the
donor's head in a solemn, reverential manner, as if blessing, pass them down the
sides, following the arms, take the stick, and sit down. Each stick thus given was
a pledge from the giver to the receiver for a pony, to be given when the visitors are
ready to return to their country. Old men, from time to time addressing the Kiowas,
urged them to liberality, to show the largeness of their hearts and the warmth of
their friendship by giving ponies to these poor Pawnees, who had come so far to see
them and renew their friendship, and not allow them to return on foot, as they
came. I know not how many ponies were thus pledged to them, but there must
have been many.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the ceremony the Pawnees arose in a body, ceased their song,
took up their flag, and a part following one Kiowa chief and a part another, accompanied
them to their lodges to partake of their hospitality. The head chief, with
four or five others, including the flag bearer, accompanied Kicking-bird to his lodge,
thus becoming his guest.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the afternoon the visitors gave a Pawnee war dance, of which
Battey wisely remarks:</p>

<div class="figright w25" id="fig152">
<a href="images/335_dp802.png">
<img src="images/335_dp802.png"
alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 152&mdash;Summer 1872&mdash;Viejo shot.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>I shall not render myself ridiculous by attempting to describe that which is indescribable....
Individuals occupied the intervals between the
dances by narrating their own former valorous exploits, not even
omitting that their victims were in some instances Kiowas, concluding
by throwing their war implements upon the ground with
such force, in case of tomahawk or hatchet, as to cause the metal
to ring. Then, with gesture of covering it up, they would go
away, leaving it to lie there; thus intimating that, though they
had been foolish and fought, they now rejoiced in the beams of
peace and hoped that the red men everywhere might live in peace
one with another; all of which was received by the Kiowas with
the loud response of "How! how! Yes! yes!" (<cite>Battey, 20</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="d1872">SUMMER 1872</h3>

<p>This summer there was no sun dance, and in consequence
the medicine lodge does not appear on either calendar.</p>

<p>For this summer the Anko calendar has two connected human figures,
together with what he explains as a "mule's head" above the
medicine pole. Between the forks of the pole is another human head,
where he commenced to draw the first figure, but found that he had no
room. The joined human figures refer to a drunken fight between
Sun-boy and T'ené-zépte, "Bird-bow" (?), growing out of some whisky
smuggled in by Mexicans, in which Sun-boy shot his antagonist with
an arrow. The mule's head indicates a raid into Kansas, in which the
Kiowa captured a large number of mules. This may have been the
same raid in which Bíako was shot.</p>

<p>The Set-t'an calendar has a picture of a man wounded in the chest,
with a tree above his head to show that the event occurred in summer.
This has reference to a skirmish with the whites in which a Mexican
captive named Bíako (Viejo) was shot, but afterward recovered. He
was one of those selected for confinement in Florida a few years later,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
and is still living and with the tribe. The fight took place in the
course of a raid into Kansas by a small party of Kiowa under T'ené'taide,
"Bird-chief," which was undertaken against the protests of the
other chiefs, who desired to be at peace with the Americans. Near
Medicine-lodge creek, not far from the Kansas line, they were joined
by some of the Osage, and soon afterward met a party of white men

resulting in the wounding of the captive and one of the Osage.</p>

<p><i>Téguăgo Tsän-de Sai</i>, "Winter that the Pueblos came." In this winter,
while most of the Kiowa were encamped on the Washita near Rainy
mountain, a party of Pueblo Indians and Mexicans visited them to
trade <i>biscocho</i>, or Pueblo bread, and eagle feathers for horses and
buffalo robes. The Kiowa were very fond of this bread and willingly
gave a pony for a small bag of it. The figure on the Set-t'an calendar
represents a Pueblo Indian, with his hair tied in a bunch behind,
driving before him a burro (donkey) with a pack
upon his back. The Kiowa say that the Pawnee
visited them late in the fall, while the Pueblo
party came in the winter, stopping south of Stumbling-bear's
present camp. From an early period
the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande had carried
on a trade with the southern plains tribes, with
which they appear to have been always on friendly
terms. This was the next to their final visit.</p>

</div>

<p>The Anko calendar records the accidental burning
of a noted heraldic tipi, hereditary in the family of the great
Dohásän. It was known as the <i>Dó-gíägyä gúăt</i>, "Tipi with battle
pictures," being ornamented with battle pictures on the northern side
and horizontal stripes of black and yellow alternating on the southern
side; it occupied the second place from the entrance in the camp circle
on ceremonial occasions. A small facsimile model has been deposited
by the author in the National Museum. Plate LXXIX shows the
appearance of the buckskin model when open and spread out.</p>

<p>The Kiowa, like the plains tribes generally, had an elaborate system
of heraldry, exemplified in the painting and decoration of their shields
and tipis. Every prominent family had its heraldic tipi, which had
its appointed place in the great camp circle of the tribe and descended
by inheritance from generation to generation. The system may form
the subject of a future study by the author.</p>

<p><i>Iyúgúa P'a K`ádó</i>, "Maggot-creek sun dance," so called because

of the North fork of Red river, near the western line of the reservation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
just within the Texas panhandle. The dance was made by
Dóhéñte, "No-moccasins," the successor of Anso te; it occurred in
June and was attended by Battey, who describes it in detail in his book.
There were present most of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, with a
large part of the Cheyenne and Arapaho, who discussed the question
of starting another war in consequence of
the continued imprisonment of Set-t'aiñte
and Big-tree. Although Battey himself had
come to bring them the news of the further
detention of these chiefs on account of the
Modok war, he was able, with the help of
Kicking-bird, to dissuade the Indians from
their hostile intent.</p>

("Black-buffalo") "stole" the wife of Guibadái,
"Appearing-wolf," in retaliation for

a number of others, in accordance with the tribal custom; he threatened
also to kill the seducer, so that the <i>Toñkóñko</i> Dog-soldiers had
to interfere. The killing of the horses or the seizure of the property of
the offender by the injured husband is the regular tribal punishment
for such offenses, but in extreme cases, as in this instance, the Dog-soldiers
interfere. The same event is recorded on both calendars, the
Set-t'an picture being sufficiently suggestive, while
the Anko calendar has above the medicine pole
the figure of a horse's head struck by a bullet,
with another head below it to represent the

<p><i>Set-t'aiñte Tsän-de Sai</i>, "Winter of Set-t'aiñte's
return." The notable event of this season was
the return of Set-t'aiñte from prison October 8,
1873. The figure above the winter mark on the
Set-t'an calendar shows Set-t'aiñte, distinguished
by his red headdress, coming into his tipi, which
was conspicuous by being painted entirely red,
with red streamers at the ends of the poles. The
red marks above the tipi are intended to represent
his return footprints. The event is noted at length
in another place.</p>

<p>The Anko calendar commemorates the killing in Mexico of two "sons"
(i. e., a son and a nephew) of Lone-wolf, rudely indicated below the
winter mark by a human figure wearing a <i>k`ódalpä</i> or shell breastplate,
with several flying bullets at the side.</p>

<p>Battey, who was in the Kiowa camp when the news arrived, has this
entry in his diary under date of January 13, 1874:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a day of wailing in our camp. News arrived this morning of the death of
two Kiowa braves, the one a son of Lone-wolf, the other of Red-otter [<i>Ápeñ-gúădal</i>]
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Lone-wolf's brother. They were killed while on a raid in Mexico. Lone-wolf's
son was wounded in the knee a year ago last summer while raiding in Texas, and
came near losing his life. This, it seems, did not satisfy his thirst for blood, and
the Kiowa determining to raid no more in Texas, he, the past autumn, went into
Mexico, where it appears he has been killed. The camp resounded with the death
wail, the song of mourning for the unreturning braves mingled with the war whoop.
This was revived at stated intervals for several days (<cite>Battey, 21</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>According to information given by the Indians to Battey, Lone-wolf's
son, with a few other young Kiowa warriors, had accompanied a raiding
party of Comanche into Mexico. On their return they were attacked
at a night camp by Mexican troops and the two Kiowa were killed.
The remaining Kiowa at once returned home with the news, but the
Comanche crossed the Rio Grande into Texas and began a series of
raids on Nueces river, when they were attacked by soldiers and several
killed. The rest started for home, but meeting another party of
Comanche, they turned back with them and were again attacked by
the troops, losing, in both encounters, twenty-two killed. A desire to
avenge these losses had much to do with the ferment among them
which led to the outbreak in the following summer; they also tried to
make it appear that the Kiowa had been raiding in Texas when killed,
in order to involve that tribe with themselves, although it seems
beyond question that the Kiowa were killed
in Mexico and had not been engaged in
the Texas raids.</p>

</div>

<p>Lone-wolf went to Mexico to bury the
body of his son, the sun dance having been
postponed in the meantime, and it is said
that on finding it he knelt down beside it
and vowed to avenge his death with the life
of a white man. A lot of government horses
were soon afterward stolen from Fort Concho
(or Clark?), in Texas, and it was charged
that this was done by Lone-wolf and his party on their return, although
they denied it. The killing of his son was the chief reason assigned
by Lone-wolf for his part in the outbreak which followed (<cite>Battey, 22</cite>;
<cite>Report, 91</cite>).</p>

<h3 id="d1874">SUMMER 1874</h3>

<p><i>Tsó`kakánă-de K`ádó</i>, "Sun dance at the end of the bluff." The
dance was held at a place called <i>Tsó`kakán</i>, "end of the bluff," on the
south side of the North fork of Red river, above the junction of Elm
fork, at a mountain called by the Kiowa the "Last mountain," in Greer
county, Oklahoma. On the Anko calendar the bluff is indicated by a
projection from one side of the medicine pole.</p>

<p>At this dance Set-t'aiñte, in thanksgiving for his release from prison,
gave his famous <i>zébat</i>, or medicine arrow-lance, to Ä´`to-t'aiñ, "White-cowbird,"
brother of the chief Sun-boy, thus resigning his own chieftainship
in favor Ä´`to-t'aiñ. There were only two lances of this kind in
the tribe, both being regarded as medicine lances, the other belonging
to Tän-gúădal (see winter <a href="#d1868_69">1868&mdash;69</a>).

</div>

<p><i>Gí-edal Ehótal-de Sai</i>, "Winter that Big-meat was killed." The
southern plains tribes, including a large part of the Kiowa, went out
together on the warpath. After the fight at the Wichita
agency, at Anadarko, in August, 1874, as previously
detailed, the Comanche warriors who were implicated fled
to the Staked plain, and the Kiowa to the head of Red
river, with the troops in pursuit. While there a small
party of the Kiowa went on a horse-stealing raid into
New Mexico, resulting in an encounter, in which they
killed two men, captured a woman, and ran off several
horses. On their return they stopped to rest in the
mountains, and were stretched at ease telling stories
when they were suddenly attacked by the soldiers.
Gi-edal was mortally wounded at the first fire, but
propped himself against a rock and succeeded in killing
one soldier and wounding another before he died.
Another Kiowa was killed also, but the troops were
finally repulsed. The Set-t'an calendar shows Gi-edal,
who is distinguished by buffalo horns on his war-bonnet,
wounded, with the blood gushing from his mouth.</p>

It was held at a spring in a bend on the north (reservation)
bank of North fork of Red river, a few miles
from <i>K`ób-akán</i>, "Last mountain" (Mount Walsh, in
Greer county). As conditions were yet unsettled on
account of the outbreak, the Kiowa were escorted on
this occasion by a body of troops.</p>

<p>The spring takes its name from the fact that on one
occasion, while the Kiowa were encamped there, some
young men "stole" two girls who had gone to the spring
for water. On the Anko calendar the place is identified
by a figure of a woman above the medicine pole.</p>

<p>In this instance the same event is recorded on both

<p>In the various engagements during the last campaign and at the
final surrender, several thousand ponies and mules had been taken from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
the Indians. These were sold under direction of Colonel Mackenzie, who
determined to invest the proceeds in sheep and cattle for the benefit of
the Indians, with the idea of changing their habits from hunting to
pastoral. A detachment of troops, accompanied by several Kiowa and
Comanche, was sent to New Mexico, where they purchased thirty-five
hundred sheep and goats, with which they returned in November, 1875,
the flock being driven by Mexican herders. Many died on the journey,
and the remainder arrived in poor condition, but recuperated in the
spring, when they were distributed to those Indians deemed most
deserving. Stumbling-bear received one hundred, and others smaller
flocks. Six hundred cattle were also purchased from the same fund
and distributed in the same manner (<cite>Report, 92</cite>).</p>

<p>Just previous to the outbreak the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache,
with the few of the Delaware tribe living among them, were officially
reported to have over sixteen thousand horses and mules. At the close
of the troubles they had only six thousand remaining, having lost ten
thousand within a little more than a year. They had also a small number
of cattle before the outbreak, but no sheep (<cite>Report, 93</cite>).</p>

<p>This was the first general attempt by the Kiowa to
raise stock (except horses). Although at the start the
experiment promised well, the herds were soon reduced
by neglect, killing for food, etc., and in a few years the
last animal was gone. It is said that some of the sheep
escaped to the Wichita mountains, where for several
years they roamed wild.</p>

were stolen." This dance was held at the junction of
Sweetwater creek and the North fork of Red river, on the western line
of the reservation. While it was in progress some Mexicans stole all
of Sun-boy's horses. After the dance the Kiowa pursued the thieves,
but their horses gave oat, and they failed to recover the stolen animals.

was some time after the sun dance, and hence is marked as happening
in winter. The woman was sick and promised Íăpa,
who was considered a doctor and was then unmarried,
that if he would make her well she would marry
him; he succeeded in curing her and she married
him, but soon after left him, and for this he stabbed
her.</p>

<p>The incident is thus noted by Agent Haworth in
his official report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young man in a mad fit killed his wife. On hearing of it,
I called a council of Kiowa chiefs and asked them to take some
action about it. I explained to them the penalties the white
man's law inflicted for such terrible crimes. After a short
consultation they decided they would do with him whatever I
said&mdash;kill him, if I said so. They said, however, that he was
young and foolish and did not know the white man's laws or
road, but they would arrest him as soon as he could be found
and bring him to me, and I could do with him as I desired.
Two of their number, Dangerous-eagle and Big-tree, about
nine oclock the same evening brought him to my house, having made the arrest
themselves. I sent them on with him to the guard-house, where he was confined
for several months, most of the time with ball and chain, working around the garrison
in full view of his people. After his arrest they made the request that, in consideration
of his ignorance of the white man's laws, his life be spared. I told them
he would not be hurt, but the arrest was made without any promises of mercy being
exacted or made, no soldiers being required, and done simply on
my suggestion or request (<cite>Report, 94</cite>).</p></blockquote>

about twenty other Kiowa braves, enlisted as scouts this
year at Fort Sill, remaining in the service two or three
years. The figure below the winter mark shows a man
holding a gun and wearing a peculiar variety of hat
then used by the scouts. The first Kiowa scouts were
enlisted at the time of the surrender in 1875.</p>

<p><i>Dä´-mä´tánä´ P'a K`ádó</i>, "Star-girl-tree river sun
dance," or <i>Á`gat-hódal K`ádó</i>, "Measles sun dance."
This dance took place within the present Greer county, Oklahoma, on
Salt fork of Red river, called by the Kiowa the "Star-girl-tree river,"
from a noted tree which originated from a sapling used in a medicine
sacrifice to the "Star girls" or Pleiades. On this occasion the troops
accompanied the Kiowa on their buffalo hunt and afterward escorted
them to the place selected for the dance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<p>This summer is noted for an epidemic of measles, which is said to
have killed more children in the tribe than the measles epidemic of
1892. It is represented on both calendars by a human figure covered
with red spots, above the medicine lodge. Strangely enough there is no
notice of this epidemic in the report of the agent for this year, which may
perhaps be accounted for by the fact that he was himself prostrated
by sickness which occasioned his retirement in the following spring.
From the report of the agent for the Cheyenne and Arapaho, however,
we learn that the epidemic broke out among the latter tribes in April,
and in spite of the best efforts of the physician, killed two hundred and
nineteen children, so that almost every family was in mourning. In
happy contrast to the more recent experience of the Kiowa, the government
school was temporarily turned into a hospital, with the teachers
for nurses, so that although seventy-four children
were sick at the same time, not one died (<cite>Report, 95</cite>).</p>

During this winter a part of the tribe camped
near Mount Scott, while the remainder camped west
of Fort Sill, at the foot of Signal mountain, called
by the Kiowa "the mountain with a house built
upon it," referring to a stone lookout station built
during the last Indian outbreak. The figure on the
Set-t´an calendar is sufficiently suggestive of a house
upon a mountain.</p>

<p>Anko records the fact that he hunted buffalo this
winter on Elk creek (on upper Red river), called by
the Kiowa <i>Dónä´-i P'a</i>, "Pecan river." The rounded
figure below the winter mark is intended to represent
a pecan nut.</p>

<p>This winter is noted for an epidemic of fever, which
is mentioned in the report for 1878. In the fall of
1877, under Agent Haworth, as an inducement to the Indians to abandon
their roaming habit, the government built houses for ten prominent
chiefs of the three tribes, including Stumbling-bear, Gaápiatañ (Heidsick),
Guñsádalte (Cat), and Sun-boy, of the Kiowa, and White-man
and Taha, of the Apache. These were the first Indian houses ever
built upon the reservation, excepting two erected by the military. At
first the new owners continued to live in the tipis, which they preferred
from long usage, but by the further gift of beds and chairs they
were induced to go into the houses. An attempt to get the Indians
to cut the logs and do a part of the work themselves under instruction
seems to have been a failure. The houses were reasonably good
frame structures of three rooms, having doors, glass windows, and
substantial double fireplaces and chimneys of stone; they cost $600
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
each (<cite>Report, 96</cite>). In 1886 there were nine Kiowa families living in
houses (<cite>Report, 97</cite>), but a few years later most of these dwellings were
vacant or occupied by white renters, the Indian owners being again
in the tipis.</p>

on the western part of the reservation to hunt
buffalo, while the others remained at home. Each
party, unknown to the other, promised to make
a sun dance, in consequence of which one dance
was held at the regular period, after which the
leaves were renewed and another dance was held for another four days.
On this occasion also the buffalo hunters, who made one sun dance,
were escorted by a detachment of troops as a protection and as a precaution
against their committing depredations (<cite>Report, 98</cite>).</p>

account of his relationship and the dignity conferred upon
him by Set-t'aiñte, if not for his personal merits, was a
prominent man in the tribe. On account of having this
lance he was also known as Zébä-dó-k`ía, "Man-who-has-the-arrows,"
i. e., "Arrowman." He was killed by Texans
while with a party who had gone, by permission of the
agent and accompanied by an escort of troops, to hunt
buffalo on upper Red river in what is now Greer county,
Oklahoma; the Texans shot him through the body and both arms,
scalped him, and cut off a finger upon which was a ring. The hunt
occurred in the winter season, but the buffalo were now so nearly exterminated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
that it was practically a failure and the Indians suffered
much in consequence. The killing with its sequel is thus noted in the
official report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Captain Nolan, commanding the company of troops who were escorting the Indians
while on the hunt, had, in view of the scarcity of buffalo, allowed parties, each
accompanied by a squad of soldiers, to go off from the main camp to points where
it was said straggling droves of buffalo could be found. While a Kiowa man was
one day a short distance from the camp of one of these parties and alone he was run
onto by a company of Texas state troops, shot down, killed, and scalped. A few
moments after this grand military feat was performed the little Indian camp was
discovered, and they were just in the act of covering themselves with additional
glory by charging it and butchering the squaws and pappooses when the squad of
colored troops presented themselves, mounted on the bare backs of their horses,
having had no time to saddle them, and the warlike band disappeared. Upon the
return of the Indians to the agency a request was made that the Texans who
murdered the Kiowa should be arrested and punished by the authorities, expressing
at the same time no intention of avenging his death themselves. It seems that
after waiting some time and concluding that nothing could or would be done by the
authorities, a party of young Kiowas, headed by the brother of the murdered man,
quietly left their different camps, dashed hurriedly across the line into Texas, killed
and scalped a white man they met in the road, and returned as secretly to their
camps, apparently feeling that they had avenged the death of their brother and
friend by this taking of one scalp.</p></blockquote>

<p>A party of troops was sent after this avenging party immediately on
learning of this last killing, but so quietly had they proceeded
that no trace of them could be found or any
definite information procured on which to base measures
for their punishment. The white man killed was named
Earle, and the agent expresses his belief that if proper
satisfaction had been made in the first place by punishing
the murderers of the Kiowa or making presents
to his family according to the Indian custom, the avenging
party would not have entered Texas on their deadly
mission (<cite>Report, 99</cite>).</p>

<h3 id="d1879">SUMMER 1879</h3>

<p><i>Tséñ-píä K`ádó</i>, "Horse-eating sun dance." It is indicated
on the Set-t'an calendar by the figure of a horse's
head above the medicine lodge. This dance was held on Elm fork
of Red river, and was so called because the buffalo had now become
so scarce that the Kiowa, who had gone on their regular hunt the
preceding winter, had found so few that they were obliged to kill and
eat their ponies during the summer to save themselves from starving.
This may be recorded as the date of the disappearance of the buffalo
from the Kiowa country. Thenceforth the appearance of even a single
animal was a rare event. The official report says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the month of June last a portion of each band was permitted to go to the western
part of the reservation to subsist themselves awhile on buffalo, deer, etc, as the
supplies for the year had been so nearly expended it was not seen how they could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
all be fed until those for the next year were received. But again they failed to find
game sufficient to feed themselves, and the Kiowa, who while out were engaged in
their annual medicine dance, suffered some with hunger. I think their failures in
finding buffalo the past year, and their consequent suffering while out, will have a
good effect in causing them to abandon their idea of subsisting in this way and to
look to their crops and stock for a support. It is a fact worthy of note that the reports
of the agents show the value of the robes and furs sold by the Indians now belonging
to the Kiowa, Comanche, and Wichita agency for the year 1876 amounted to $70,400;
for 1877, $64,500; for 1878, $26,375; while in 1879 only $5,068 was received, showing
that buffalo hunting is not a thing of profit as it once was; and, besides, the most
serious drawback to the Indians is the lack of the buffalo meat which at one time
helped to subsist them, and which, added to the insufficient rations furnished by
the government, kept them partly comfortable. As that supply is
cut off, the Indian must go to work and help himself or remain
hungry on the rations furnished (<cite>Report, 100</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Anko calendar records the fact that while the Kiowa
were driving away their issue of beef cattle some mischievous
boys, shooting at the cattle with their arrows, accidentally
shot another boy in the shoulder, but not fatally.
In giving this explanation it was evident that Anko did
not want to mention the boy's name, probably because
he was now dead.</p>

<p><i>Tä´kágyä Sai</i>, "Eye-triumph winter." The name and
story furnish a curious illustration of Indian belief.
Káäsä´nte, "Little-robe" (or Little-hide), with two or three
others, had gone to the North fork of Red river to look
for antelope. According to another story they went to
look for their old enemies, the Navaho, who, it seems,
although now removed to their former reservation in
western New Mexico, still occasionally penetrated thus
far. Among them was a man named Pódodal (a variety
of bird), who claimed to understand the language of owls,
a bird believed by the Kiowa to be an embodied spirit.
While resting one night in camp this man warned Little-robe
not to go to bed, but to round up the ponies and keep watch over
them, for an owl had told him that the Navaho would try to steal them
that night. During the night Pódodal fired at something in the darkness,
and on looking in the morning they found the trail of a man, and
blood drops, which they followed for a long distance, but at last gave
up the pursuit. That night the owl again came and told Pódodal that
the wounded Navaho was lying dead beyond the point where they had
turned back, and that he (the owl) would go and fetch him.</p>

<p>On rising in the morning Pódodal saw some strange-looking object
lying on the ground in the lodge, and on examining it it proved to be
the eye of a dead Navaho. On the advice of Pódodal they then
abandoned the hunt and returned to the Kiowa camp, on a small branch
of Apache creek (<i>Sémät P'a</i>), an upper branch of Cache creek. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
carried with them the eye, hung at the end of a pole after the manner
of a scalp, and danced over it as over a scalp on arriving at the camp
on the small stream, since called <i>Tä´-kágyä P'a</i>, "Eye-triumph creek"
from this circumstance.</p>

<p>It should be added that there were some skeptics who laughed at the
whole story and declared that the eye was that of an antelope which
Pódodal had secretly shot.</p>

<p>On the Set-t'an calendar the event is indicated by a figure intended
to represent a scalp at the end of a pole, carried by a man wearing a
striped robe to indicate his name, Little-robe. On the Anko calendar
there is a representation of a scalp on a pole under the winter mark.</p>

<p>This summer there was no sun dance, perhaps on account of failure
to find buffalo, and instead of the medicine lodge the summer is indicated
on the Set-t'an calendar by the figure of a leafy
tree above a square figure, which is explained as meaning
that the author of the calendar stayed at home, the
lines being intended to show a space inclosed in a fence
after the manner of a white man's farm. A similar
device is several times used for the same purpose in later
years. Under date of September 1, 1881&mdash;a year later&mdash;the
agent says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Last year I was encouraged in the belief that the Indians under
my charge were rather disposed to lay aside these ideas and
ceremonies, from the fact that very little was heard of their
medicine men during the year, and the Kiowas failed to hold
their annual "medicine dance." The latter part of this year,
however, from some cause, their medicine men have been unusually active, as I learn
has been the case at other agencies, and the Kiowas have recently returned from the
western part of their reservation, where they held their annual dance (<cite>Report, 101</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Anko calendar records the death of a chief named Päbóte,
"American-horse." He was a man of unusual height and size, hence
his name, which signifies literally an animal taller than the average.
He was buried in a coffin by the whites at the agency nearly opposite
Fred's store. On the calendar the square figure below the picture of
the man, and connected with it by a line, is intended to represent the
coffin.</p>

<p>On first explaining the calendar, in 1892, Anko evaded the mention
of this man's name, in accordance with the Kiowa custom which forbids
naming the dead, but three years later consented to do so. The
same objection was frequently encountered, but finally overcome in
regard to other names on the calendars.</p>

<h3 id="d1880_81">WINTER 1880&mdash;81</h3>

<p>For this winter the Set-t'an calendar has a house over the winter
mark, but he could not remember whose house it was intended to represent.
In Captain Scott's notes it is said to be Paul Set-k'opte's new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
house, but Set-k'opte did not return from the east until 1882. It is
probably intended to represent a new house built for another, Paul
Zoñtam, who returned from the east in 1881 as an ordained Episcopal
minister.</p>

<p>The Anko calendar records the visit of a large party of Pueblo
Indians from New Mexico, indicated by a human figure below the winter
mark with the hair bunched up in Pueblo fashion. There were
about a hundred of them and they stopped at various camps of the
Kiowa and Apache, remaining some time. This was the
last time the Pueblos ever visited these tribes. In the
following fall Big-bow returned their visit.</p>

<p><i>K`ádó Sä' lä´ti</i>, "Hot-sun dance," or <i>Dóguătal Sáomhäpä-de
K adó</i> "Sun dance when blood came up from the
young man." It was called the "hot sun dance" from
the fact that it was held late in August, instead of in
June as usual, the delay being due probably to the difficulty
of finding a buffalo for the purpose; after a long
search a solitary bull was found. The dance was held
on North fork of Red river, a short distance beyond the
end of the mountains.</p>

<p>The close upright lines between the forks of the medicine
pole on the Anko calendar he explains to indicate the heat, probably
from the Indian gesture sign for fire, made by
holding the hand with thumb and fingers together
pointing upward, and separating them with a quick
motion, the concept being the upward motion of the
sparks and smoke.</p>

<p>The suggestive figure on the Set-t'an calendar records
an incident which gives another name to this sun dance,
a young man, the adopted son of Poor-buffalo, having
been attacked by hemorrhage. He was called Măsá`te,
"Six," from the fact that he had six toes on each foot;
his brother, Bóhé, still living, is said to have six fingers
on each hand, Such instances of malformation are at
least as rare among Indians as among whites.</p>

<h3 id="d1881_82">WINTER 1881&mdash;82</h3>

<p><i>Ĭmdádóá-de Saiá</i>, "Winter when they played the <i>dó-á</i> medicine
game." This winter is noted for a great <i>dó-á</i> game played under the
auspices of two rival leaders, each of whom claimed to have the most
powerful "medicine" for the game. The game was played in the winter
camp on the Washita, near the mouth of Hog creek, the Kiowa leader
being Pa-tepte, "Buffalo-bull-coming-out," alias Dátekâñ, now dead (see
summer <a href="#d1882">1882</a>), while his opponent was the Apache chief and medicine-man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Dävéko. The Kiowa leader was recognized distinctively as having
"medicine" for this game, and it was said that he could do wonderful
things with the "button," making it pass invisibly from one hand to
another while he held his hands outstretched and far apart, and even
to throw it up into the air and cause it to remain there suspended invisibly
until he was ready to put out his hand again and catch it; in other
words, he was probably an expert sleight-of-hand performer. His
Apache rival, Dävéko, is known as a medicine-man as well as a chief,
and is held in considerable dread, as it is believed that he can kill by
shooting invisible darts from a distance into the body of an enemy.
On this occasion he had boasted that his medicine was superior for the
<i>dó-á</i> game, which did not prove to be the case, however, and as the
Kiowa medicine-man won the victory for his party, large stakes were
wagered on the result and were won by the Kiowa. It is said that
this was a part of Pa-tepte's effort to revive the old customs and amusements
on a large scale. The game was witnessed by
a large concourse, all dressed and painted for the
occasion. The picture on the Set-t'an calendar is
very suggestive.</p>

<p class="hang2"><small><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 171&mdash;Winter 1881&mdash;82&mdash;Dó-á game; medicine tipi.</small></p>
</div>

<p>The name <i>dó-á</i> signifies the "tipi game," from <i>do</i>,
tipi or house, and <i>a</i>, a game, because, unlike most
of their games, it is played inside the tipi, being
essentially a game for the long nights when the whole
tribe is assembled in the winter camp. A similar
game is found among nearly all our wild tribes; it is
played by both sexes, but never together. In its
general features it resembles our game of "hunt the
button," the players forming a circle around the fire
in the tipi, one-half of them playing against the
others, sitting facing them on the opposite side of
the fire. The leader of one party then takes the <i>k`íäbo</i> or button, a
short piece of stick wrapped around the middle with a strip of fur and
small enough to be concealed in the hand. Putting his closed hands
together, he raises his arms above his head, clasps them across his
chest or puts them behind his back, endeavoring to pass the <i>k`íäbo</i>
from one hand to another, or from his own hand to that of his next
partner, without being perceived by any of the opposite party, all the
while keeping time to the movements of his hands with one of the peculiar
<i>dó-á</i> songs, in which the members of his party join.</p>

<p>When the opposing player thinks he has detected in which hand the
other has concealed the stick, he indicates it with a peculiar jerk of his
thumb and index finger in that direction, with a loud <i>Tsoq</i>! (Comanche
for "That!"); if he has guessed correctly, he scores a certain number of
points, the account being kept by means of a bundle of green-painted
tally sticks. He then takes the <i>k`íäbo</i> and begins a similar set of
movements in time to another song, in which his partners join; so the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
game goes on far into the night, until the contest is decided and the
stakes won by one side or the other. It is a most animated and interesting
game, of which they are very fond, and frequently at night in the
winter camp the song chorus may be heard from several games in progress
simultaneously, the high-pitched voices of the women in one tipi
making a pleasing contrast to the deeper tones of the men in another.</p>

<p>The Anko calendar notes the building of a medicine tipi by Dátekâñ,
for the purpose of bringing back the buffalo (see summer <a href="#d1882">1882</a>). The
tipi is shown below the winter mark.</p>

</div>

<p>This summer Dohásän, whose hereditary duty it was to supply the
buffalo for the sun dance, failed to find even one, and in consequence
there was no dance. For this summer the Anko
calendar notes the death of Pätso`gáte, "Looking-alike,"
a daughter of Stumbling-bear, noted for her
beauty. In accordance with the tribal custom in
regard to speaking of the dead, Anko for a long
time refused to mention her name. The incident is
indicated by the figure of a woman where the medicine
pole is usually pictured.</p>

<p>The Set-t'an calendar notes the excitement caused
by the efforts of Dátekâñ, or Pa-tepte, to bring back
the buffalo, also noted by Anko in the preceding
winter season. The figure represents the medicine-man
seated in his sacred lodge, wearing his ceremonial
red blanket trimmed with eagle feathers, and
with a buffalo beside him.</p>

<p>The buffalo had now disappeared, and with it the
old Indian life, the sacred sun dance, and all else
that they most cherished threatened also to pass away. According to
Kiowa mythology, the buffalo originally lived in a cave underground,
from which they had been released by their great hero <i>Sinti</i> and scattered
over the prairies for the benefit of his children, the Indians.
Somewhat similar beliefs are entertained by other tribes. As the
buffalo had disappeared with the coming of the white man, who, by
reason of his superior knowledge, was rapidly dispossessing the Indian,
the native tribes almost universally believed, not that the buffalo had
been exterminated&mdash;a calamity too terrible for their comprehension&mdash;but
that it had been shut up again underground by their enemy, the
white man, in order more easily to accomplish their subjection. It was
believed that by prayer and sacred ceremonial the buffalo might again
be released to furnish food and life for the Indian, and in every tribe
there sprang up medicine-men who undertook to effect the restoration.</p>

<p>Among the Kiowa this task was adventured by a young man named
Dátekâñ, "Keeps-his-name-always," who announced early in 1882 that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
he had had a vision in which he received a mission to bring back the
buffalo. Accordingly, he began to make medicine and assumed the
name of Pá-tépté, "Buffalo-bull-coming-out," in token of his new powers.
He was already noted in other directions as a medicine-man, and
had been the winner in the great <i>dó-á</i> contest mentioned in the calendar
of the preceding winter. It is possible that his success on that
occasion encouraged him to this attempt, as he began his buffalo medicine
immediately afterward. He erected a medicine tipi, in front of
which he set up a pole with a buffalo skin upon it, and prepared for
himself a medicine shirt ornamented with blue beads, over which he
threw a red blanket trimmed with eagle feathers. Thus attired, and
carrying a sacred pipe in his hand, he began his mystic ceremonies
within the tipi, and from time to time announced the results to the
people, most of whom believed all he said and manifested their faith by
gifts of blankets, money, and other property; they were further commanded
to obey him implicitly, on pain of failure of the
medicine in case of disobedience. His pretensions were
opposed by the younger men among the returned prisoners
from the east, who used all their influence against him, but
with little effect. After nearly a year of medicine-making,
being unsuccessful, he announced that some one had violated
some of the innumerable regulations, and that in consequence
his medicine was broken for the time and they
must wait five years longer, when he would begin again.
Before that time had elapsed, however, he died, but his
claims and prophecies were revived and amplified five years
later by Pá-iñgya (see summer <a href="#d1888">1888</a>).</p>

<h3 id="d1882_83">WINTER 1882&mdash;83</h3>

<p>For this winter the Set-t'an calendar records the death
of a woman named Bot-édalte, "Big-stomach," indicated
by the figure of a woman with an abnormal abdomen
above the winter mark.</p>

<p>The Anko calendar notes that the Indian police camped this winter
on <i>Dónä´i P'a</i>, "Pecan creek" (Elk creek of North fork of Red river),
indicated, as in 1877&mdash;78, by the figure of a pecan nut below the winter
mark. The Texas cattle trail crossed at that point and the police were
stationed there to keep the cattle off the reservation. Quanah, chief
of the Comanche, was there also in the interest of the cattlemen, and it
was through his persuasion that the allied tribes finally agreed to lease
their grass lands.</p>

<p>Anko notes also that the Indians now "began to talk about grass
leases," but that as yet there was no grass money paid. It is indicated
on the calendar by three circles for dollars below the winter mark,
with a +, intended for a picture of the Indian gesture sign for "cut
off" or "stop," made by bringing the extended right hand downward
in front of the other, as if cutting a rope with a knife-stroke.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span></p>

<p>On this subject the agent says, under date of August 17, 1883:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The grass question seems to be the most difficult thing I have to contend with. I
find it impossible to keep trespassing cattle entirely off the reservation, and we are
now crowded on all sides. It seems to do very little good to put them off, for it is
found that cattle that have just been driven off will come back on the reservation as
soon as the police force advances. Our Indians are not disposed to rent the grass,
yet if it is used it seems they should be paid for it.... The grass should be utilized
in some way that will benefit the Indians, and if it is not possible to supply
them with herds sufficient to consume it, it does seem as if the grass should be
rented and the Indians receive the money for it (<cite>Report, 103</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The final result was the establishment of the system of grass leases.</p>

<p><i>Â´dalk`atói K`ádó</i>, "Nez Percé sun dance," so called on account of
a visit from the Nez Percés, called by the Kiowa the "people with hair
cut off across the forehead." The figure above the medicine pole on
the Anko calendar is intended to represent a man in the act of cutting
off his front hair. The Set-t'an calendar has beside the medicine lodge
the figure of a man wearing the peculiar striped blanket
of the Nez Percés. This sun dance is sometimes known
as <i>Máp'ódal K`ádó</i>, "Split-nose sun dance," because held
on the Washita on pasture lands inclosed by a cattle
man known to the Indians by that name.</p>

<p>On account of difficulties with the whites, the Nez
Percés of Chief Joseph's band had left their homes in
eastern Oregon in the summer of 1877, and after a retreat
of a thousand miles were intercepted in Montana by
General Miles, when within a few miles of the British
border, and compelled to surrender. They were brought as prisoners
to Fort Leavenworth, and thence removed, in July, 1878, to a reservation
assigned to them in Indian Territory. The climate and surroundings
proving entirely unsuited to them, they were returned to reservations
in Washington and Idaho in 1885, their numbers in the meantime
having been reduced from about four hundred and fifty to three hundred
and one, about one-third of their whole number having died. It
was while domiciled in Indian Territory that they visited the Kiowa
and other tribes, dancing with the Kiowa and Apache at the head of
<i>Sémät P'a</i>, "Apache creek" (upper Cache creek), and attending the
Kiowa sun dance, which was held on the north side of the Washita,
about ten miles above Rainy-mountain creek, near where now is Cloud
Chief. This was the first time the Kiowa had ever seen the Nez
Percés, although they had a dim traditional memory of them in their
old northern home.</p>

<p>In the spring of this year the keeper of the <i>taíme</i> medicine, Set-dayá-ite,

<p>For this winter the Set-t'an calendar has the picture of a house with
smoking chimney beside a tipi. It appears to be a canvas house, such,
as those Indians in a transition state sometimes use. Set-t'an explains
it to mean that Big-tree was given a stove by the government and put
it into a large tipi which he occupied; but Scott's
informant, who is corroborated by Anko and others,
explains it as meaning that Gákinãăte, "Ten," the
brother of Lone-wolf, built a house this fall on the
south side of the Washita, about opposite Cobb
creek. Stumbling-bear says that he himself had
received a stove as far back as 1875, two years
before the government built his house.</p>

<p>The Anko calendar records the taking of a large
number of children to the Chilocco Indian school,
near Arkansas City, Kansas. The heavy drafts
made during the term to furnish children for Chilocco
and other schools very considerably reduced the
number of pupils in attendance at the reservation
schools; according to the agent's statement, seventy
were thus taken at one time (<cite>Report, 103</cite>). The figure
below the winter mark is intended to represent two
wagons filled with children.</p>

<p>Anko notes also that a party of Dakota came down to dance with the
Kiowa, indicated by the feather dance-wand at the side of the winter
mark.</p>

<p>There was no sun dance this summer, and the Set-t'an calendar has
only the figure of a tree to indicate summer, with a
figure below intended to represent an inclosed field,
implying that the owner stayed at home. Concerning
this the agent says, under date of August 28:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Kiowas have danced less this year than usual, and they seem
to have given up their annual medicine dance, for as yet they have
said nothing about it. The holding of this dance has always been
a great occasion and considered one of their most important ceremonies,
for they have believed it absolutely necessary to secure
their health and success in all their undertakings, either at war
or in the chase. They have generally gone out on the plains from
40 to 60 miles from the agency and been absent from five to six
weeks. On several occasions since the buffalo disappeared, they
have suffered very much with hunger while out, and I hope we have
heard the last of the dance (<cite>Report, 104</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The calendar of Anko for this summer notes the hauling of government
freight by the Kiowa, including himself, indicated by a figure of a
wagon where the medicine pole would otherwise be. This was in agreement
with a plan inaugurated several years before, by which those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
Indians who had suitable teams and wagons&mdash;the latter furnished by
the government&mdash;were permitted to haul supplies for the agency and
were paid for their labor as an inducement to get them to adopt the
white man's industries. As there was no railroad near at that time,
most of the freight had to be hauled overland from Caldwell, Kansas,
a distance of 150 miles. For such labor during this year the Indians
received nearly $8,000, and performed the work cheerfully
and in a satisfactory manner (<cite>Report, 105</cite>).</p>

<h3 id="d1884_85">WINTER 1884&mdash;85</h3>

<p>The Set-t'an calendar has a house above the winter
mark, which is interpreted to mean that the Kiowa camped
all winter on the Washita near Set-k`opte's house, just
above the agency. This was the fact, but another informant
suggests that the original intention was to
record the event that the Kiowa about this time began
to build houses for themselves. On this subject the
agent says at this time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These Indans retain much of their roving disposition, and except
during the cropping season do not camp long in one place, but do
not go far from their fields. Few of the Kiowas, Comanches, and
Apaches have houses, and most of them live in tents. This will
probably be the last of their savage customs to be abandoned
(<cite>Report, 106</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1886 it is officially stated that only nine Kiowa
families were living in houses, all the rest being in tipis (<cite>Report, 107</cite>).</p>

<p>The Anko calendar records the stealing of another man's wife by
Tón-ak`á, "Notched-tail," i. e. "Water-turtle," a noted medicine-man,
for which the woman was whipped and a number of Tón-ak`á's horses
were killed by the injured husband. The turtle
below the winter mark indicates the event.</p>

<h3 id="d1885">SUMMER 1885</h3>

<p><i>Píhó K`ádó Sän</i>, "Little Peninsula sun dance,"
so called because it was held in a peninsula
formed by a bend of the Washita about twenty
miles above the agency; the same place where
another dance, the <i>Píhó K`ádó</i>, had been held in
1839. The figure on the Set-t'an calendar shows
the medicine lodge within the bend (see summer
<a href="#d1839">1839</a>). The figure on the Anko calendar is
intended to represent the medicine pole with the buffalo head fastened
below the forks.</p>

<p>On this occasion Dohásän had to go to the Staked plain to find a
buffalo for the purpose. This dance was the first held by Taímete, the
successor of Set-dayá-ite. On this point the agent has to say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I mentioned in my last report the fact that the annual medicine dance of the
Kiowa would not be held that year, and I expressed the hope that they had abandoned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
it; but their old medicine man has since died, and his successor, unfortunately
a young man of little ability or character, ordered that another be held this year.
The Comanche have no such ceremonial as an annual dance, and the
other tribes of the reservation have no medicine dance, but the Caddoes
frequently meet together and dance for enjoyment, as white
people do (<cite>Report, 108</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Anko calendar notes that the Comanche received
their first grass money this summer, shown by the circles
for dollars below the medicine pole, but with nothing to
indicate the tribe. The Kiowa did not make leases until
a year later. For some reason, perhaps on account of a
change of agents which occurred about this time, there
is no notice of this payment in the official report.</p>

destroyed all the tipis and much of the
other property of T'ébodal's and Â'dal-pepte's
camps, northwest of Mount Scott, while most of
the tribe had gone to the agency for rations. The
Set-t'an calendar indicates the event by means of the
picture of a tipi, streaked with red for the fire, above
the winter mark. The Anko calendar has below the
winter mark a peculiar symbol, which he explains to
mean the rising flames.</p>

a field.</p>

<p>As there was no dance, the Anko calendar for this
summer lacks the medicine pole, while by means of a star
and several circles he records the fact that he enlisted
in the agency police force, and also that there was another
payment of grass money by the cattlemen, this time
to the Kiowa, being the first they had received.</p>

<h3 id="d1886_87">WINTER 1886&mdash;87</h3>

<p>For this winter both calendars note the suicide of
Peyi, "Son-of-the-sand," nephew of the great chief Sun-boy.
Having taken a horse without the owner's permission,
he was reproved for it, which so hurt his feelings that, saying,
"I have no father, mother, or brother, and no one cares for me," he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
went out and shot himself with a revolver. Indians are very sensitive
to reproof or ridicule, and suicides among them from this cause are more
frequent than is generally supposed.</p>

<p>The Set-t'an calendar has above the winter mark the figure of a man
holding a pistol, and with a wound in his side, the blood gushing from
his mouth. The Anko calendar has a pistol below the winter mark.
Two circles (dollars) above the winter mark have evidently
been placed there inadvertently.</p>

<p><i>K`adóliä P'a K`ádó</i>, "Oak creek sun dance." According
to the Set-t'an calendar, there was no sun dance this
summer and everybody remained at home&mdash;indicated as
before by the figure of a leafy tree above a square inclosure.
This, however, is a mistake. The agent states that
"the Kiowas held this year a sun dance with my permission,
but with a distinct understanding that it should be
the last, and (it) was not of a barbarous nature" (<i>Report,
109</i>). The dance was held near the mouth of <i>K adóliä P'a</i>, "Oak creek,"
a small southern tributary of the Washita above Rainy-mountain
creek, and takes its name from the stream on which it was held. As
the wild buffalo had now been exterminated, the animal for this occasion
was bought from a ranchman named Charles Goodnight, who had
a small herd of domesticated buffalo in northern Texas.</p>

<p>The name of the creek on which the dance was held
was originally <i>Do`gótä P'a</i>, "Oak creek," but in consequence
of the death of a woman named <i>Do`gótä</i> about
1891, the name was tabooed according to tribal custom,
and the stream is now known as <i>K adóliä P'a</i>, from an
old word which conveys the same idea.</p>

<p>This winter the Indians received a large number of
cattle from the stockmen in part payment for their grass
leases; the remainder was paid in money. These were
the first cattle received from that source. A number of
the Indians refused to accept them and insisted on money, while
quite a large number refused to have any part in the leases, believing
it to be a plot to deprive them of their lands. The event is indicated
on both calendars by the figure of a cow's head in connection
with the winter mark.

<p>By a mistake Set-t'an depicts a medicine lodge for this summer
instead of for the one preceding. No sun dance was held this year,
owing to the opposition of the new agent. In his official report he
states that early in May the chiefs and head men of the Kiowa had
called to request permission for the holding of the dance at the regular
season, but that on investigation he became convinced that it should
not be allowed and so informed the Department, which instructed him
to prevent it, even by calling on the military if necessary. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On receipt of this information I at once communicated the fact to the Indians,
but could not get them to promise to abandon it. I informed them that on the
slightest intimation that any preparation was being made for the celebration of the
dance I would be compelled to call on the military and cause the arrest of every
Indian who expressed a determination to participate in the same. Many of the
young men, belonging to the worst element, privately declared their intention of
holding the dance, but as yet nothing has been done in that direction. I am firmly
of the opinion I will be able to prevent it without the aid of the troops (<cite>Report, 110</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang2"><small><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 184&mdash;Summer 1888&mdash;Sun dance (?); Pá-iñgya's prophecy.</small></p>
</div>

<p>The Anko calendar records for this summer the preaching of the
prophet Pá-iñgya. It is indicated by a figure intended
to represent a flying bullet, referring to his claim of invulnerability.</p>

<p>Pá-iñgya, "In-the-middle," had commenced preaching
during the previous winter, reviving the doctrine
of the return of the buffalo, which had been taught
by Pa-tepte several years before (see summer <a href="#d1882">1882</a>).
He continued to preach and make medicine for several
months, adding to his predecessor's prophecies another
of the invulnerability of his followers and the speedy
destruction of the whites, so that for a while the excitement
assumed a dangerous form. In the official
report for 1887 the agent briefly notes that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Kiowas were troublesome in the early spring, owing to the bad advice of their
medicine-men and chief Lone-wolf, and refused to plant their seed and took
their children from school. Later on they went to work, but would have made a
much better showing in their crops had they planted earlier (<cite>Report, 111</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>According to Pá-iñgya's pretensions, he was the legitimate successor
of Pa-tepte, with all of his predecessor's powers and considerably more
of his own. He predicted the near approach of a mighty whirlwind,
which would blow away the whites and all Indians living among them
or following their customs. After the whirlwind would come a great
prairie fire, which would burn for four days and consume the agency
buildings, schools, and all that the white man had established in the
country, together with any whites left by the whirlwind. Having thus
cleared the way, he would then restore the buffalo and game, with all
the old Indian life. His followers were commanded to resume at once
their aboriginal dress and weapons, with all the old habits. He made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
a sacred new fire with the block and stick, according to the primitive
Indian method, and gave the fire thus made to all his disciples to be
used instead of that procured from matches or flint and steel; he
refused to give any of this sacred fire to those chiefs and others who
were regarded as being on the white man's side, including Stumbling-bear
and Sun-boy. He established his headquarters on upper Elk
creek, near Lone-wolf's camp, in the western part of the reservation, to
which he commanded all the faithful to repair in order to escape the
destruction which was to come upon the whites and their renegade supporters,
and appointed ten assistant priests, to whom he delegated a
share of his powers and duties. To quiet any fear of interference by
the authorities, he claimed to have a medicine which would render his
followers invulnerable, while he himself was not only invulnerable but
could kill soldiers or other enemies by his mere glance, as by a lightning
stroke, as far as he could see them.</p>

<p>His preaching roused great excitement among the Kiowa, nearly all
of whom&mdash;excepting those of Stumbling-bear's and Sun-boy's bands&mdash;abandoned
their homes and repaired to the appointed place on Elk
creek, the parents taking their children from the schools in order that
they might not be involved in the general conflagration and destruction.
In the summer the prophet's son died, and he promised to raise
him from the dead in the fall, but when the time came his medicine
unaccountably failed.</p>

<p>The unrest among the Indians, for which no apparent cause could be
assigned, greatly alarmed the whites, who feared that the Indians
meditated an outbreak. As a precaution, the agent, Captain Hall,
summoned a detachment of troops, and taking with him a small escort,
went to the neighborhood of the prophet's camp and sent Stumbling-bear
and Sun-boy to him to bring him and some of the prominent
chiefs in order to discuss the matter. The result was that the Kiowa
agreed to go home and await developments. As the time fixed for the
fulfillment of the prophecy came and passed without event, they became
convinced that they had been deceived and the excitement died out.
In the meantime Pá-iñgya, who had before been poor and obscure,
had become rich by the horses and blankets which he had received
from the faithful; there were even those who were so uncharitable as
to say that it was for this he had been working. Nothing was done to
punish the prophet, who still lives, and when the news of the messiah
came a few years later, he claimed it as the fulfillment of his prophecy.
He has more recently assisted to revive the ghost dance at his home
on the Washita.</p>

<p>The name of this dance, <i>Íâm Guan</i>, is derived from i,
"child or offspring," and <i>âm</i>, the root of the verb "to
make," for the reason that one of its main features is the
formal adoption, by the visiting dancers, of a child of
the other tribe. The performance and dress somewhat
resemble those of the Omaha dance, but only two men
dance, while the rest sit around as spectators. There is
an exchange of horses by the visited tribe for presents
placed on the ground by the visitors, and at the end of
the ceremony the boy adopted is formally restored to his
people. This dance is found also among the Wichita
and Pawnee and perhaps other tribes.</p>

<p>The Kiowa had decided to celebrate their usual annual
sun dance at the <i>Piho</i> or bend in the Washita, where
they had already held it twice before, when the agent
determined to prevent it. They were not disposed to
yield, and had assembled in their great tribal circle of
tipis, with the center pole of the medicine lodge already
erected, having an old buffalo robe in lieu of a buffalo
head and skin at the top, when word came that the
troops were on their way to stop the dance, having been
sent from Fort Sill for that purpose by request of the
agent. The news was brought to Stumbling-bear, who had remained
at home on account of the death of his son, by Quanah, chief of the
Comanche, who advised him to send word to the Kiowa to stop, as the
soldiers would kill them and their horses if they persisted. Stumbling-bear
thereupon sent two young men to the sun dance
camp to tell the Kiowa to disperse and go home, which,
after considerable heated discussion, they finally did, leaving
the unfinished medicine lodge standing. In the meantime
the troops had arrived at the agency, but the Indians
having gone home, they returned to their post.</p>

<p>Concerning this affair the agent says in his annual report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There has been nothing of special note during the year, with the
exception of the excitement raised in connection with the proposed
sun dance. That matter having been fully laid before the department,
it is hardly necessary to say more (<cite>Report, 113</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same subject the report of the Secretary of War says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The commanding officer at Fort Sill reported July 19 that the Indian
agent had notified him of the intention of the Indians to hold a
medicine dance, and had asked for troops to prevent them from doing
this. He was directed to be guided by instructions of last year on the
subject, and consequently three troops of cavalry proceeded to Anadarko, Indian
Territory, on July 20,... but the Indians having abandoned the plan of holding
their dance upon the arrival of the troops, the latter, after remaining at the point for
a few days, were withdrawn (<cite>War, 7</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="d1890_91">WINTER 1890&mdash;91</h3>

<p><i>Pá-ä´ngya Tsän-de Sai</i>, "Winter that Sitting-bull came." This refers
to the first coming among the Kiowa of Sitting-bull, the Arapaho
prophet of the ghost dance, in the fall of 1890. The human figure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
above the winter mark is intended for Sitting-bull. The first Kiowa
ghost dance was held on this occasion on the Washita at the mouth
of Rainy-mountain creek, and was attended by nearly the whole tribe.
Even the progressive chief Stumbling-bear attended and encouraged
the dance, in the hope and faith, as he says, that by so doing his youth
would be renewed. About the same time the Kiowa sent Ä´piatañ,
"Wooden-lance," to visit the northern tribes and the messiah himself
for the purpose of investigating the truth of the reports. The event is
recorded on the Anko calendar by means of the figure of a man wearing
a head feather and a shell breastplate, as Ä´piatañ did when he
started on his journey. He returned in February, 1891.</p>

<p>As the whole subject of the ghost dance has been exhaustively
treated by the author in his report on "The ghost-dance religion" in
the Fourteenth Annual Report, it is unnecessary to give here more
than the reference by the agent in his report for 1891:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Ghost dance.</i>&mdash;This has been a disturbing occurrence throughout most of the year.
This form of dancing has been indulged in mostly by the tribes north of the river.
The Kiowas sent some of their number to the north to investigate the matter.
Ah-pe-ah-tone, the leader in this journey, returned in the early spring and brought
such a report with him as thoroughly convinced the Kiowas of the falsity of the
so-called messiah. They have danced little or none since his return. The Wichitas
and Caddos have clung to the superstition and danced until spring. They were led
to greater excess by the visit of Sitting-bull, the Arapaho prophet from the north,
who is becoming rich in stock through the gifts of his followers. He has been absent
in the north, but has now returned to the Cheyenne and Arapaho agency and will
probably repeat his performances of last year. Our Wichitas have already commenced
to dance again and the Comanches seem to be feeling the craze, and unless
decided measures are taken, we will probably have a repetition of last year's scenes
(<cite>Report, 113</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>For the same winter, but above instead of below the winter mark, the
Anko calendar records the death of three schoolboys, indicated by the
picture of a boy in civilized dress holding a book. Their names were
<i>Sétä</i>, "Small-cow-intestines;" <i>Ká-ikonhódal</i>, "Dragonfly," and <i>Mótsä-tsé</i>,
from the Spanish <i>muchacho</i>, "boy," his mother being a Mexican
captive. They were attending the government Kiowa school, and one
of them had been whipped by a teacher, in consequence of which the
little fellow, with the two others, ran away from school and attempted
to reach their homes, some 30 miles out in the mountains. The same
night a terrible blizzard came on, and after they had struggled painfully
along nearly the entire distance they sank in the snow, exhausted
by fatigue, cold, and hunger, and all were found a few days later lying
together, frozen stiff, on the bleak slope of a mountain, by a search
party of Indians. This occurrence nearly precipitated an outbreak,
and for a time it was thought that troops would be necessary to
quell the disturbance, but through the judicious management of
Captain H. L. Scott, who was sent from Fort Sill to investigate and
report on the situation, the Indians were quieted without resort to
force.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<p>In his official report, Captain Scott says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was learned that three Kiowa boys had run away from the Kiowa school on the
9th [of January, 1891], on account of a whipping the eldest one had received from
one of the teachers, Mr Wherrit. They had been overtaken by a snowstorm, the
most severe this country has seen for years, and had been frozen to death. The
body of the eldest, "Sailor" [from Setä?], about 14 years old, had been found, and
they were still searching for the other two. They had been trying to reach the
Kiowa camp on Stinking creek. The talk about the threatening attitude of the
Kiowas being inquired into, it was resolved into this, that some of the school children
had said that "Mother Goodeye," a one-eyed Kiowa woman, related to one of the
dead children, had said that if she caught Mr Wherrit she would stick a knife into
him. This, coupled with the fact that the woman afterwards denied having said it,
would not seem to demand the presence of two troops of cavalry. It was said that
Mr Wherrit had hid himself the day before, and had fled the agency during the
night to escape the coming wrath (<i>From report of Captain H. L. Scott to Post Adjutant,
January 18, 1891; copy in Indian Office, 5070&mdash;1891</i>).</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same subject the agent says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The loss of the three boys who ran away from the Kiowa school and were frozen
to death in the snow, was an occurrence which might have been productive of most
serious results. It speaks well for the Kiowa Indians that it not
only was passed without such consequences, but seems to have left
no prejudice against the school. It has been most gratifying to
me on several occasions during the year to note the growing spirit
of self-control among these people, and their desire to stand by
lawful authority (<cite>Report, 114</cite>).</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="d1891">SUMMER, 1891</h3>

<p>There was no sun dance, and consequently, instead of
the medicine lodge, the Set-t'an calendar has the square
inclosure to show that he stayed at home.</p>

<p>The event of the summer was the killing of P'ódalä´ñte
(abbreviated <i>P'olä´ñte</i>], "Coming-snake," in Greer county,
Oklahoma. He was shot by a young white man in self-defense,
as it was claimed, while endeavoring to recover a horse which
he said had been stolen from him; he had sent a boy after the animal,
but the holders had refused to give it up except to the owner.
P'ódalä´ñte himself then went after it and a dispute followed, resulting
in his death. It is said he was shot as he was loosening his gun from
its scabbard at the saddle. The Kiowa claim not to know the particulars,
as no other Indian was with him at the time, but say that he
was notoriously quarrelsome and rough in his manner. The shooting
occurred opposite the mouth of Elk creek. It is indicated on the
Set-t'an calendar by means of a human figure, with blood flowing from
a wound in the side, standing above the square inclosure, with a
snake behind it to show the name. Anko records it for the following
winter, q.v.</p>

<p>The Anko calendar records for this summer a visit made by the Kiowa

<p>The Anko calendar records here the killing of P'ódalä´ñte, as just
described for the preceding summer, the discrepancy arising
perhaps from the fact that it occurred after the middle
of summer. It is indicated below the winter mark by
means of the figure of a man, with a bullet wound in his
side, lying in a coffin or grave, and with a snake above
the winter mark to show his name.</p>

<p>The Set-t'an calendar records the enlistment of the Indian
troop at Fort Sill in the spring and summer of 1891. It
was composed chiefly of Kiowa, and was organized as troop
L of the Seventh cavalry, under command of Lieutenant
(now Captain) H. L. Scott. It is indicated by the figure
of a soldier above the winter mark.</p>

<h3 id="d1892">SUMMER 1892</h3>

<p>The event of this summer was the measles epidemic. The Set-t'an
calendar indicates it by means of a human figure covered with red
spots, and beside it the leafy tree and square inclosure to show that it
occurred in the summer, when there was no dance and everybody
remained at home. The Anko calendar has a similar red-spotted figure.</p>

</div>

<p>The epidemic broke out early in spring and continued through the
summer; it began in the Kiowa school, and its terribly fatal consequences
were due largely to the course pursued by the superintendent,
who insisted on sending the sick children back to the
camp, where it was impossible for them to receive
necessary attention, instead of caring for them in the
school. The result was that the infection spread
throughout the Kiowa and Apache tribes, and as the
Indians, in their ignorance, endeavored to <i>wash out
the blotches</i> by drenching the children in cold water,
nearly every case was fatal. Watching and anxiety
brought fevers and other sickness to the parents, so
that there was not a family in the two tribes that did
not suffer the loss of a near relative. The feeling
already existing among the Kiowa against the superintendent, on
account of the death of the schoolboys the year before, was now so
intensified that he was obliged to leave the country.</p>

<p>When the author returned to the Kiowa in the early summer of that
year, the epidemic had nearly spent its force, although deaths were still
occurring every day or two. The condition of the Indians was pitiable
in the extreme; nearly every woman in the tribe had her hair cut off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
close to her head and her face and arms deeply gashed by knives, in
token of mourning, while some had even chopped off a finger as a sign
of grief at the loss of a favorite child. The men also had their hair
cut off at the shoulders and had discarded their usual ornaments and
finery. On one occasion, while driving near the camp, the author's
attention was attracted by a low wail, and on looking for the cause he
saw, sitting in the tall grass near the roadside, a bereaved father
stripped to the breech-cloth, with his hair cropped close to the head
and the blood dripping from gashes which covered his naked body; he
did not look up or turn his head as the wagon passed, but continued
the low wail, with his eyes cast to the ground. Wagons, harness, tipis,
blankets, and other property were burned, and horses and dogs shot
over the graves of their owners, to accompany them to the world of
shades, the destruction of property in this way amounting to thousands
of dollars. Every night and morning the women went into the hills
to wail for their lost ones, and returned to camp with the blood dripping
from fresh gashes in their faces and arms; this continued for
weeks and months, far into the fall.</p>

<p>The responsibility for this terrible calamity rests upon the school
superintendent, who sent the infected children into camp, and upon the
agent who permitted it. The superintendent of the Comanche school,
so soon as the disease appeared on the reservation, suspended teaching,
turned the school into a temporary hospital, with the teachers as
nurses, and stationed a guard of police to keep the parent from interfering
with or withdrawing the children. The result was that not one died
in his school and only one was affected. The census of the Kiowa and
Apache tribes for this year shows a decrease from the preceding year
of two hundred and twenty-one, or 15 per cent, among the two tribes,
due almost entirely to this epidemic. The agent reports, after noting
the mortality:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The above deaths occurred chiefly among the infants and young children, and can
be attributed to the fact that in most every case they invariably immersed their sick
in the water, thereby causing death in every case thus treated (<cite>Report, 115</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr J. D. Glennan, attending surgeon to the Indian troop at Fort
Sill, had already distinguished himself at Wounded Knee two years
before by his bravery and coolness in attending to the needs of the
wounded and dying while bullets were flying thick around him. Now,
when the epidemic broke out among the Kiowa, he gave his services
with the same quiet devotion to duty, with such good result that,
although for months the hospital camp was crowded with stricken
Indians, whose relatives outside were dying all over the reservation,
only six of those under his care died, and these not from the prevailing
epidemic, but from a complication of diseases. In recognition of
his services the Kiowa soldiers afterward raised a sum of money with
which to purchase a horse for him, but as the doctor already had a
horse, the testimonial took the form of a valuable piece of silver.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span></p>

<p>The Anko calendar has also a row of circles, representing dollars, to
indicate a large payment of grass money by the cattlemen this summer.
As by this time the Indians had learned that the leasing of their surplus
grass lands was very much to their advantage, they held a council in
February, 1892, to select delegates to go to Washington for the purpose
of negotiating leases for the whole reservation; also to secure some back
payments due from previous leases. Quanah, Lone-wolf, and White-man
were chosen on behalf of the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache, respectively,
and proceeded to Washington, where they received the desired
permission, under which authority leases were negotiated producing
for the three tribes an average income of about $100,000. On their
return they received through a special agent nearly $70,000 due under
the new and old leases. This large payment gave occasion for general
rejoicing and marked an era in their history. A large part of the money
was invested in lumber for building permanent houses; so that in this
way, and with the additional help of a small appropriation for the hire
of carpenters, the agent reports about sixty houses built within the
year, and says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With the assistance of the Indian Office as to the pay of carpenters, together with
the revenues from their grass leases, I see no reason why in the near future the
tepee should not be banished and comfortable houses he substituted in their stead
(<cite>Report, 116</cite>).</p></blockquote>

<p>Here end the yearly calendars. The subsequent events, including
the unratified treaty negotiations and the present condition of the
tribes, will be found noted in the preliminary tribal sketch.

</ul>

<h3 id="THE_SEASONS">THE SEASONS</h3>

<p>The Kiowa distinguished only four seasons, unlike some of the agricultural
tribes of the east, who distinguished five, separating the autumn
season into <i>early</i>, when the leaves change color, and <i>late</i>, when the
leaves fall, but assigning entirely different names to each. The Kiowa
begin the year with the beginning of winter as fixed by the first snowfall.
This seems to have been the case also with the Pawnee and perhaps
with other prairie tribes. To an agricultural people the renewal
of vegetation would seem a more natural starting point.</p>

<p>The first season is called <i>Saígya</i> or <i>Säta</i>, abbreviated <i>Saí</i>, which is
considered to begin on the first fall of snow. In western Oklahoma
this is generally about the first or middle of December, although on
one occasion, about ten years ago, this occurred as early as October.
Cold weather and frost may come, but it is not called <i>Saígya</i> until
snow falls.</p>

<p>Next comes <i>Áségya</i>, spring. This is an archaic term which cannot
be analyzed. It is sometimes called by the more modern name of
<i>Són-páta</i>, "grass springing." It is considered to begin when the grass
and buds sprout and the mares foal (about first of March), and is known
to be near at hand when the breasts of the eagles begin to turn white
and when the panther whelps are born. The old men say that one half
of the month <i>Ka`gúăt P'a Sän</i> belongs to <i>Saígya</i> and the other half
to <i>Áségya</i>.</p>

<p>The third season is <i>Paígya</i> or <i>Paíta</i>, abbreviated <i>Pai</i>, summer. The
name seems to have a connection with the word for sun, <i>pai</i>. It begins
after the grass has ceased sprouting (<i>sónpáta</i>) and is considered to
continue until fires are needed in the tipis at night, i. e., from about
June to September. During this season the fires are made outside
the tipis, or, rather, outside the leafy arbors under which the people sit
and sleep during the hot weather.</p>

<p>Next comes the fourth and last season, <i>Paóngya</i> or autumn. The term
is archaic and seems to refer to the thickening of the fur (<i>pa</i>) of the
buffalo and other animals as the cold weather approaches. It is sometimes
called <i>Aídeñ-gyägúădal-ómgyä-i</i>, the time "when the leaves are
red." The season is supposed to begin when the leaves change color
and fires become comfortable in the tipis at night, that is, about the first
of September.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

<p>In addition to these recognized divisions the summers or warm weather
periods, as distinguished from the winters, were usually counted by
<i>k`ádós</i> or sun dances, which were commonly held once a year, the time
being fixed by the whitening of the down on the cottonwoods, about
the beginning of June.</p>

<p>The following table is a good approximation of the manner in which
the Kiowa divide the year, beginning about October 1:</p>

<h3 id="KIOWA_MOONS_OR_MONTHS">KIOWA MOONS OR MONTHS</h3>

<p>While the Kiowa note the changes of the moon and have a fixed
name for each moon or lunar month, it is not to be supposed that their
system could have the exactness of the calendar systems of the more
cultivated nations of the south, or perhaps even of the sedentary tribes
of the east, whose interests so largely depended upon noting carefully
the growth and ripening of crops, the appearance of the various species
of fish in the streams, etc. Nevertheless, they have a system, imperfect
though it be, and it can not be said of them, as Matthews says of some
northern tribes, that "they have no formal names for the lunar periods."
In this, as in other matters of tribal lore, they defer to the superior
knowledge of certain old men who assume the position of experts on
the subject.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<p>The Kiowa recognize twelve or more moons or months, beginning
the year, according to one authority, with the first cold weather, about
the end of October, or according to other authority, with the first snowfall,
about a month or more later. They have seven distinct moon or
month names, and some of these are duplicated and distinguished as
<i>great</i>, <i>small</i>, or of <i>summer</i>, to make the full number for the year. These
moons of course do not coincide closely with our calendar months, and
as the system is necessarily imperfect, there is a discrepancy of authorities,
some recognizing twelve moons while a few count as many as
fourteen or fifteen, the additional names being a further duplication of
some of the others, as already explained; all authorities agree on the
first eight as here given, and all but one agree on the ninth, after
which there is a discrepancy. The author has made no arbitrary
attempt to harmonize conflicting statements, as the result would be
artificial and not aboriginal; and we must expect a certain amount of
uncertainty and disagreement on such a complicated subject, among
primitive people. Our own calendar system has been of slow growth,
and more than one hundred million Europeans still refuse to accept it.
The list here given is that obtained from Anko, the best calendar
authority in the tribe, and is that generally accepted by the Kiowa.
By means of tally dates from his picture calendar their periods can be
pretty closely assigned, although, as will be noticed, even he varies a
month in some instances in the course of three years. Some of the old
men put another moon, <i>Pai Ka`gúăt P'a Sän</i> (see <a href="#n5">number 5</a>), between
<i>Pai Gáñhíña P'a</i> and <i>T'águñ´ótal P'a Sän</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">1. <i>Gákiñăt'o P'a</i>&mdash;"Ten-colds moon." It is so called because the first ten days of it
are cold, a premonition of winter, after which it grows warm for a time; this
moon is about equivalent to late September and early October. It is the first
and last moon of the Kiowa year, the old year and the summer being considered
to end with the full moon of this period, after which the winter and the new year
begin; by the time this moon ends the leaves are off the trees; in talking with
Anko on September 23 (1895) he said: "This is <i>Gákiñăt'o P'a</i>, but it is still summer.
After the moon is full and again begins to wane, then winter has begun,
and we are in the <i>winter half</i> of <i>Gákiñat'o P'a</i>." Snow sometimes comes in
this moon.</p>

<p class="hang" id="n2">2. <i>Ȧ gâ´nti or Ä`ga´ntsänha</i> (does not take <i>p'a</i>), from <i>ä`gâ´ntsän</i>&mdash;"wait until I come,"
or "I am coming soon." According to Kiowa folklore, this moon says to his predecessor,
"You went, but did nothing. <i>Hítugŭ´ ä`gâ´ntsän</i>&mdash;wait, and I'll go, and
I'll show what I can do in the way of storms and cold weather." This moon
includes parts of October and November. A tally date is the lunar eclipse of
November 4, 1892, which is noted on the Anko calendar as occurring in this
moon. Some authorities speak of it also as <i>sä-kop p'a</i>, "midwinter moon," i. e.,
midway between two consecutive sun dances, which would seem to bring it
nearer to December.</p>

<p class="hang" id="n3">3. <i>Tépgañ P'a</i>, "Geese-going moon," so called because the geese now begin to pass
overhead on their migration southward; it may bo considered to include parts
of November and December, and is sometimes called <i>Bonpä P'a</i>, "sweat-house
moon," for some unexplained reason. (See number 9, <i>Pai Tépgañ P'a</i>.)</p>

<p class="hang" id="n4">4. <i>Gañhíña P'a</i>, "Real-goose moon," so called because in this moon the great southward
migration of wild geese occurs; it may be considered to comprise
parts of December and January, although some put it later, as one old man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
talking on the subject on January 25, said: "We are now in the beginning of
<i>Gañhíña P'a</i>."</p>

<p class="hang" id="n5">5. <i>Ka`gúăt P'a Sän</i>, "Little-bud moon." This may be considered to include late
January and early February; in this moon the first buds come out, especially
those of the elm, called by the Kiowa <i>tá-ä</i>, or <i>gádal-ä</i>, "saddle-wood," or
"buffalo-wood." The first part of this moon is regarded as belonging to winter
(<i>saígya</i>), the latter part to spring (<i>áségya</i>). Anko says that the mares foal
in this moon and that the white men (in Oklahoma) usually begin to plow. A
tally date from his calendar makes a February event occur in this moon.</p>

<p class="hang">6. <i>Ka`gúăt P'a</i>, "Bud moon." It is sometimes distinguished from the preceding by
adding <i>edal</i>, "great;" the buds are all out and it is now full (<i>áségya</i>), spring;
it is considered to include parts of February and March.</p>

<p class="hang">7. <i>Aideñ P'a</i>, "Leaf moon." The leaves are all out by the end of this moon, which
approximately comprises late March and early April. Anko remarks that
the moon names already given, with the two <i>T'aguñótal P'a</i>, are all old
recognized names, but that this moon has no proper name. It is here also that
the discrepancy begins on the other lists; a tally date on the Anko calendar
gives April 19 as belonging to this moon.</p>

<p class="hang">8. <i>Pai Ȧgâ´nti</i>, "Summer <i>Ägâ´nti</i>" (see <a href="#n2">number 2</a>). This moon is so named because, in
Kiowa folklore, it says to its predecessor, "Just watch me; pretty soon I'll make
it hot. Spring (<i>áségya</i>) ends and summer (<i>paígya, pai</i>) begins after this moon
is full and begins to wane; it maybe considered approximately to include late
April and early May, but a tally on the Anko calendar puts an event of June
14 within this period.</p>

<p class="hang" id="n9">9. <i>Pai Tépgañ P'a</i>, "Summer <i>Tépgañ</i> moon" (see <a href="#n3">number 3</a>). It is possible that this
moon is so called on account of a northward migration of wild geese, although
it seems too late in the season. According to the testimony of white observers
on the Kiowa reservation, wild geese appear first in October, stay all winter
in the lakes and ponds, and go north again in March and April. The wild
ducks, in the rivers, remain all the year. The name may have kept this place
as part of the series from the time when the Kiowa lived in the far north,
where the seasons are of course later. It usually comprises parts of May and
June, although in one place Anko puts the 4th of July in this moon; in
other places he puts the same date in the next or second moon following. It
is one of the summer moons.</p>

<p class="hang">10. <i>Pai Gañhíña P'a Sȧn</i>, "Summer <i>Gañhíña</i> moon" (see <a href="#n4">numbers 4</a> and <a href="#n9">9</a>). This is also a
summer moon, approximating June-July. Tallies from the Anko calendar put
events of July 4 and July 20 within this moon, to which also he says belongs
the time of school closing, about June 20.</p>

<p class="hang">11. <i>Táguñótal P'a Sȧn</i>, "Little-moon-of-deer-horns-dropping-off," because the deer
now begin to shed their horns. This is another summer moon, equivalent to
July-August, and was considered to begin after the annual sun dance. Tallies
from the Anko calendar give to it an event of July 29, and in one instance the
celebration of July 4.</p>

<p class="hang">12. <i>Táguñótal P'a</i> (<i>Edal</i>), "(Great-) Moon-of-deer-horns-dropping-off," because when
it is at an end, all the deer have shed their antlers. This moon comprises
August-September; summer ends and fall (<i>páongya</i>) begins in the middle of
this moon. It is sometimes also called <i>Aídeñgúak`o P'a</i>, "Yellow-leaves
Moon," because the leaves now begin to change color.</p>

<h3 id="MOONS_OR_MONTHS_OF_OTHER_TRIBES">MOONS OR MONTHS OF OTHER TRIBES</h3>

<p>Some extracts from standard authorities on other wild tribes may be
of interest in connection with the moons or months of the Kiowa.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

<p><i>Hidatsa and Mandan</i>&mdash;"Many writers represent that savage Indian
tribes divide the year into twelve periods corresponding to our months,
and that each month is named from some meteorological occurrence or
phase of organic creation observable at the time. Among others, Maximilian
presents us with a list of twelve months; 'the month of the
seven cold days,' 'the pairing month,' 'the month of weak eyes,' etc.;
he introduces this list in one of his chapters descriptive of the Mandans.
He does not say it is their list of months, but publishes it without
comment, and yet it is presented in such a manner as to lead the
reader to suppose that it is the regular and original Mandan calendar.
Other authors present lists of Indian months in much the same way.
As the results of my own observations, I should say that the Mandan
and Minnetaree are generally aware that there are more than twelve
lunations in a year, that they as yet know nothing of our manner of
dividing the year, and that although, when speaking of 'moons,' they
often connect them with natural phenomena, they have no formal names
for the lunar periods. I think the same might be said of other tribes
who are equally wild.</p>

<p>"The <i>Hidatsa</i> recognize the lapse of time by days, lunar periods, and
years; also by the regular recurrence of various natural phenomena,
such as the first formation of ice in the fall, the breaking of the ice in
the Missouri in the spring, the melting of the snowdrifts, the coming
of the wild geese from the south, the ripening of various fruits, etc.
A common way of noting time a few years ago was by the development
of the buffalo calf <i>in utero</i>. A period thus marked by a natural
occurrence, be it long or short, is called by them the <i>kadu</i>, season, time,
of such an occurrence. Some long seasons include shorter seasons;
thus they speak of the season of strawberries, the season of service-berries,
etc., as occurring within the season of warm weather. They
speak of the seasons of cold weather or of snow, of warm weather,
and of death or decay, which we consider as agreeing with our seasons
of winter, summer, and fall; but they do not regularly allot a certain
number of moons to each of these seasons. Should you ask an interpreter
who knew the European calendar what were the Indian names
of the months, he would probably give you names of a dozen of these
periods or natural seasons, as we might call them, corresponding in
time to our months. In a few years, when these Indians shall know
more of our system of noting time than they now do, they will devise
and adopt regular Hidatsa names for the months of our calendar"
(<cite>Matthews, 4</cite>).</p>

<p><i>Pawnee.</i>&mdash;"They had no method of computing years by calendric
notation. Occasionally a year that had been marked by some important
event, as a failure of crops, unusual sickness, or a disastrous hunt,
was referred to as <i>a year by itself</i>, but at a few years' remove even this
mark became indistinct or faded altogether away. Any occurrence ten
or twelve years past was usually designated as <i>long ago</i>. Their great
use of the past was not as history, but simply as a storehouse of tradition,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
and this tendency soon enveloped the most important events with
a semi-traditional glamour. When time was computed by years, it was
done by winters. The year comprised alternately twelve and thirteen
moons or months.... The intercalary month, <i>ŭsarĕr´ăhu</i>, was usually
inserted at the close of the summer months. The regular months were
grouped as with us by threes, the first three constituting winter
(<i>pi´c̀ĭkŭt</i>), the second three spring (<i>ora´rĕkaru</i>), the next three summer
(<i>li´ŭt</i>), the last three autumn (<i>lĕtskukĭ</i>). The year was also divided into
two seasons (<i>kŭt´ĭharu</i>), a warm and a cold. As may be readily anticipated,
there was much confusion in their system of reckoning by
moons. They sometimes became inextricably involved and were obliged
to have recourse to objects about them to rectify their computations.
Councils have been known to be disturbed, or even broken up, in consequence
of irreconcilable differences of opinion as to the correctness of
their calculations."</p>

<p>"As an aid to the memory, they frequently made use of notches cut
in a stick or some similar device for the computation of nights (for days
were counted by nights) or even of months and years. Pictographically
a day or daytime was represented by a six or eight pointed star, thus,
<big>*</big>, as a symbol of the sun. A simple cross, thus X (a star), was a
symbol of a night; and a crescent, thus ☾, represented a moon or lunar
month" (<cite>Dunbar, 1</cite>).</p>

<p><i>Dakota, and Cheyenne.</i>&mdash;"The Dakota count their years by winters
(which is quite natural, as that season in their high levels and latitudes
practically lasts more than six months), and say a man is so many
snows old, or that so many snow seasons have passed since an occurrence.
They have no division of time into weeks, and their months are
absolutely lunar, only twelve, however, being designated, which receive
their names upon the recurrence of some prominent physical phenomenon.
For example, the period partly embraced by February is called
the 'raccoon moon'; March, 'the sore eye moon;' and April, that in
which the geese lay eggs. As the appearance of raccoons after hibernation,
the causes inducing inflamed eyes, and oviposition by geese
vary with the meteorological character of each year, and as the twelve
lunations reckoned do not bring them back to the point in the season
where counting commenced, there is often dispute in the Dakota tipis
toward the end of winter as to the correct current date" (<cite>Mallery, 4</cite>).</p>

<p>"Some tribes have twelve named moons in the year, but many tribes
have not more than six; and different bands of the same tribe, if occupying
widely separated sections of the country, will have different
names for the same moon. Knowing well the habits of animals, and
having roamed over vast areas, they readily recognize any special moon
that may be mentioned, even though their name for it may be different.
One of the nomenclatures used by the Teton-Sioux and Cheyenne
beginning with the moon just before winter is as follows:</p>

<p>1. The moon the leaves fall off.</p>

<p>2. The moon the buffalo cow's f&oelig;tus is getting large.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span></p>

<p>3. The moon the wolves run together.</p>

<p>4. The moon the skin of the f&oelig;tus of buffalo commences to color.</p>

<p>5. The moon the hair gets thick on buffalo f&oelig;tus; called also "men's
mouth" or "hard mouth."</p>

<p>6. The sore-eyed moon; buffalo cows drop their calves.</p>

<p>7. The moon the ducks come.</p>

<p>8. The moon the grass commences to get green and some roots are
fit to be eaten.</p>

<p>9. The moon the corn is planted.</p>

<p>10. The moon the buffalo bulls are fat.</p>

<p>11. The moon the buffalo cows are in season.</p>

<p>12. The moon that the plums get red" (<cite>Clark, 16</cite>).</p>

<p><i>Klamath and Modok.</i>&mdash;Their months "do not coincide with the months
of our calendar, for they extend from one new moon to the next one,
and therefore should be more properly called moons or lunations.
Twelve and a half of them make up the year, and they are counted on
the fingers of both hands. The first moon of their year begins on the
first new moon after their return from the <i>wokash</i> harvest [about the
end of August], at Klamath Marsh, which is the time when all the provisions
and needful articles have been gathered in for the winter. They
have now generally discarded the former method of counting moons
upon fingers, and instead of it they reckon time by the seasons in which
natural products are harvested (<cite>Gatschet, 1</cite>).</p>

<p><i>Bannock.</i>&mdash;They distinguish the earlier moons thus: First, "running
season for game;" second, "big moon;" third, "black smoke" (cold);
fourth, "bare spots along the trail" (i. e., no snow in places); fifth,
"little grass, or grass first comes up." They have no names for moons
after the season gets warm (<cite>Clark, 17</cite>).</p>

In this moon the three schoolboys were frozen to death,
as already related (winter 1890&mdash;91); they ran away
from the school on January 9, 1891, and are represented
by the figures as wearing hats and holding
out a book. Anko drew only two figures, but explains
that "everybody knows there were
three."</p>

returned this month (February, 1891)
from his visit to the Indian messiah (see winter
<a href="#d1890_91">1890&mdash;91</a>). The two strokes show that he

the moon. About this time a commission came to negotiate with the
Caddo and Wichita for a sale of their reservation; an agreement was
reached in June, 1891 (<cite>Report, 117</cite>). The figure shows a white man
and an Indian beside a sectional figure to represent the allotments

July, on which occasion there are always great gatherings of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
Indians for races at Fort Sill and Anadarko. Anko ran races with
the rest, but lost his bet. The figure

the bet.</p>

moon. The Kiowa visited the Cheyenne
to dance the "Pueblo dance,"
which they obtained originally from the
Pueblo Indians, and received in return
several war-bonnets as presents; in this
dance the men carry rattles in their
hands, and the women follow behind.
The picture shows a man wearing

<h2 id="THE_KIOWA_LANGUAGE">THE KIOWA LANGUAGE</h2>

<h3 id="CHARACTERISTICS">CHARACTERISTICS</h3>

<p>So far as at present known, the Kiowa language has no affinity with
any other, but it is possible that closer study and more abundant
material will establish its connection with some one of the linguistic
stocks on the headwaters of the Missouri and the Columbia, the region
from which the tribe has migrated to the south. All of the language
that has hitherto been printed is comprised in a list of one hundred
and eighty words collected by Bartlett in 1852 ("Personal Narrative,"
1854), and in fifteen songs of the ghost dance, published by the author
in 1896 in the Fourteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.
To these may be added a few words and sentences printed in phonetic
type in a little paper called "The Glorious Sun," published at irregular
intervals in 1895 at Anadarko by Lewis D. Hadley. There is also in
possession of the Bureau an extended manuscript vocabulary with
texts collected on the reservation by Albert S. Gatschet in 1880.</p>

<p>Although the Kiowa language is really vocalic, nearly every syllable
ending in a vowel and there being but few double consonants, yet the
frequency of the explosive or aspirated sounds renders it unpleasing to
the ear and unfitted for melodious musical composition, such as we find
in the Arapaho and Caddo songs. It has, however, a forcible effect in
oratory on account of the strong distinct enunciation of nearly every
vowel and syllable, the vigor of the gutturals and dentals, and the
redundance of the sonorous <i>o</i>. The distinct emphasis put upon nearly
every syllable gives to sentences the effect of a chant or recitation,
while the frequent rising inflection lends a querulous tone to an ordinary
conversation.</p>

<p>The language lacks <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, and <i>r</i>. In attempting to pronounce English
words, <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>l</i> are substituted, respectively, for these sounds, while
<i>ch</i> is changed to <i>ts</i>. The diphthong <i>au</i> is also wanting, and short <i>û</i>
occurs only in a few words of foreign origin. With the exception of <i>ă</i>
short or obscure, the vowels are generally long. <i>D</i> has a slight explosive
sound and approximates <i>t</i>. Before <i>l</i> it is softened or sometimes
even entirely elided, the vowel being lengthened to supply the hiatus.
Thus in Bartlett's vocabulary we find <i>ol</i>, <i>k'ul</i>, and <i>kol</i> for <i>âdal</i>, <i>k`odal</i>,
and <i>gadal</i>. The same change is made by the Kiowa in pronouncing
English words of like character, as <i>sā̈&#776;l</i> for <i>saddle</i>. The most common
vowel sounds are <i>a</i>, <i>ä</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>o</i>; <i>â</i> with certain speakers becomes <i>o</i>, and
<i>e</i> is weakened to <i>i</i>. Nasal vowels are frequent. There are several
aspirated or medial sounds and a strong explosive <i>k`</i>. Below is given
the list of sounds according to the Bureau system, nasals being indicated
by <i>ñ</i>. A frequent rising inflection at the end of words, represented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
by some authors by means of a final <i>h</i>, is here indicated by the
accent <i>´</i>.</p>

<p>Like all other living languages, the Kiowa is undergoing a process
of gradual change, and many archaic forms and expressions are used
by the old men, particularly in reciting myths, which are unknown or
difficult of interpretation by the younger people. The same fact has
been noted among other tribes (<cite>Matthews, 5</cite>). The changes are more
rapid in Kiowa on account of the tribal custom, already mentioned,
of substituting new words for any which suggest the name of a person
recently deceased. Even such common words as <i>dog</i>, <i>bird</i>, and <i>moccasin</i>
have thus been entirely changed within a few years, and some old
men remember as many as three different words used at different
periods for the same object. As this process has been going on for an
indefinite length of time, it of course adds difficulties to the work of
investigating the linguistic affinities of the language. In most, if not
all cases, however, the new word is not an actual new creation, but a
new combination of old root forms.</p>

<p>In most tribes we find the priests using in their ceremonial rites a
peculiar dialect, full of archaic forms and figurative expressions unintelligible
to the common people. This is probably true also of the
Kiowa.</p>

<p>Traces of dialectic forms appear in the language, and from this fact
and from statements of the old people, it is probable that some at least
of the six recognized Kiowa tribal divisions previously described, were
originally distinct, but cognate and allied, tribes, speaking different
dialects. The extinct K`uăto particularly are said to have spoken the
language in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p>A few words from other Indian languages, occurring in the text, are
also included in the glossary. Corrupted popular forms of Indian words
are printed in capital letters.</p>

was originally called <i>Pa´-do`gâ´-i</i> or

(from <i>pa</i> and <i>do-`gâ´-i</i>), and this name
was afterward changed to <i>Doha´</i> or

prominent chief. (2) His son was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
originally called <i>Ä´anoñ´te</i> (a word of
doubtful etymology), and afterward
took his father's name of <i>Doha´te</i>,
which was changed to <i>Doha´sän</i>, "Little
Dohate," or "Little-bluff," for distinction.
He became a great chief,
ruling over the whole tribe from 1833
until his death in 1866. His portrait
was painted in 1834 by Catlin,
who calls him <i>Teh-toot-sah</i>, and his
name appears on the treaty of 1837

(3) His son, whose widow is
Anki´mä, inherited his father's name,
Doha´sän, was also a distinguished
warrior, and died about three years
ago. His scalp-shirt and war-bonnet
case are now in the National Museum.
(4) The nephew of the great Doha´sän
II and cousin of the last mentioned
(3) was also called Doha´sän,
and always wore a silver cross with
the name "Tohasan" engraved upon
it. He was the author of the Scott
calendar, and died in 1892; shortly
before his death he changed his name to

husband (3) to bear the hereditary
name, which is now extinct.</li>

<a href="#d1862_63">1862&mdash;63</a>). The literal meaning may be
"wolf song," i. e., <i>gu´i-da´gya</i>. "Just

a Kiowa girl captured by the

by the dragoons in 1834. Catlin,
who painted her picture, calls her
"Wun-pan-to-mee, the white weasel."
<i>Gu´npä´ñda´-i</i> is the owner's "medicine,"
or protecting talisman, usually
kept in a bag or pouch tied inside the
tipi and just above the junction of the
bed curtain to that one of the three
principal poles which stands nearly
opposite the entrance. The Cheyenne
sometimes hang it outside, near the
door. The word is compounded from
<i>guntä</i>, tipi pole, <i>da´-i</i>, medicine, and
<i>pä</i>, the root of the verb <i>gyäpä´-imo</i>, I
tie. The suffix <i>-mä</i> makes it a feminine
name. The medicine, as also the
tipi pole to which it is attached, are
also called <i>komtä´ga</i> or <i>komtă&#776;´-gu´n-da</i>.
In this case the medicine may have
been inclosed in a bag made of white
ermine skin. The three principal tipi
poles tied together are called <i>gunpä</i>
(<i>gun</i> and <i>pä</i>); the Comanche tipi has
four principal poles.</li>

<i>pi´a´ta´`ga</i>, "he stabs with a spear."</li>

<li>guntä&mdash;tipi pole; plural, <i>gun</i>. Tipi
poles are made preferably of cedar, on
account of its durability and freedom
from liability to warp; they are sometimes
made of cottonwood. Twenty is
the average estimate to a tipi, besides
the two outside poles. Cf. <i>gu´ăn</i>, dance.</li>

<li id="Gwahalepa">Gwa´hale p'a&mdash;"Kwahadi creek;" West

<li id="Gyaiko">Gyai´`ko&mdash;Comanche; "enemies;" singular,
<i>Gyaik`i</i>, <i>Gyai´mä</i>, from <i>nyägyai´to</i>.
This name "Enemies," is the common
Kiowa name for the Comanche, now
their close allies (see page <a href="#Page_162">162</a> <i>et passim</i>).
Other Kiowa names for them are
(1) <i>Sänko</i>, now obsolete, probably signifying
"snakes," from <i>sä´ne</i>, snake;
(2) <i>P'o´dalk`i´ägo</i>, or <i>P'o´dalgyä´ko</i>,
"reptile people," from <i>p'odal</i> and <i>k`i´ägo</i>.
This last name is probably a substitute
for the previous term <i>Sänko</i>, on the
occasion of the death of some person
of somewhat similar name. The early
French explorers called them <i>Pa´douca</i>,
from their common designation among
the Dakota, Osage, and cognate tribes.
It may possibly be derived from
<i>Pe´nätĕ´ka</i>, the name of the easternmost
division of the Comanche.

<dd>This work was originally published in 1875 by Thomas C. Battey, the
first teacher among the Kiowa, and remains today the best extended
account of the tribe, despite some inaccuracies in his statement of
their traditions, due in part to the fact that his information was
obtained chiefly through the imperfect medium of the sign language
before the days of competent Kiowa interpreters. He is still (1897)
living at Mosk, Ohio, and has aided the author in various ways in
connection with the present work.</dd>

painted, including that of the great Dohásän.</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>Gray-eagle.</i>&mdash;Kiowa Apache (<a href="#fig58">figure 58</a>, page <a href="#Page_247">247</a>). The Apache delegates
at Washington in March-April, 1898, do not know this name,
and say the picture is intended for that of another member of the
delegation of 1872, a Kiowa Apache young man, not a chief, named
Ná-ishañ-déná, "Apache-man."</li>

<li><i>Dävéko</i>&mdash;(<a href="#fig60">figure 60</a>, page <a href="#Page_250">250</a>). The name seems to mean
"Recognizes-enemies," referring to one who can distinguish at a great
distance the identity of an approaching hostile party.</li>

<li><i>Goñk`oñ</i>&mdash;(Plate <a href="#LXXIV">LXXIV</a>). "Defends-his-tipi," i. e., one who stands
guard at his tipi and prevents a hostile entrance. The name is
inherited from his grandfather. Goñkoñ is the brother of Dego, alias
Peso or Pacer, former principal chief of the Kiowa Apache. (See <a href="#ENGLISH-KIOWA_GLOSSARY">English-Kiowa glossary</a>).</li>

<li><i>Ka-ati-wertz-ama-na</i>&mdash;(<a href="#fig49">figure 49</a>, page <a href="#Page_195">195</a>). This name, as
written on the photograph furnished by former agent Lawrie Tatum,
seems to be a corrupted Comanche form, but neither the name nor the
picture can be identified by the Indians to whom it has been
submitted. He is described in the inscription as "a brave man, not
afraid of any Indian."</li>

<li><i>Ná-ishañ-déna</i>&mdash;instead of <i>Ná-isha-déna</i>, for the native name of
the Kiowa Apache (see page <a href="#Page_245">245</a>).</li>

<li><i>Parker's ranch</i>&mdash;instead of Barker's ranch, page <a href="#Page_270">270</a>.</li>
